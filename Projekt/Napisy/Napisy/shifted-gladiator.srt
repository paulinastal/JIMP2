1
00:03:17,829-->00:03:18,908
Sir.

2
00:03:18,997-->00:03:20,491
General.

3
00:03:31,134-->00:03:32,249
Sir.

4
00:03:47,233-->00:03:48,858
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:52,113-->00:03:54,818
Still nothing?
Not a sign.

6
00:03:54,908-->00:03:58,443
How long has he been gone?
Nearly two hours.

7
00:04:00,789-->00:04:02,580
Will they fight, sir?

8
00:04:02,666-->00:04:04,124
We shall know soon enough.

9
00:04:04,209-->00:04:06,878
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

10
00:04:06,961-->00:04:09,287
They're out of range.
Range is good.

11
00:04:10,840-->00:04:14,256
The danger to the cavalry
Is acceptable. Agreed?

12
00:04:23,937-->00:04:25,182
They say no.

13
00:04:50,964-->00:04:53,502
People should know
when they're conquered.

14
00:05:03,977-->00:05:05,768
Would you, Quintus?

15
00:05:06,688-->00:05:07,968
Would I?

16
00:05:24,706-->00:05:27,411
Strength and honor.

17
00:05:33,048-->00:05:36,167
At my signal, unleash hell.

18
00:05:58,907-->00:06:00,449
Load the catapults.

19
00:06:01,326-->00:06:03,283
Infantry form up for advance.

20
00:06:04,746-->00:06:07,154
Archers ready.
Archers!

21
00:06:07,248-->00:06:08,707
Nock!

22
00:06:32,524-->00:06:33,899
Fratres!

23
00:06:33,984-->00:06:35,941
Maximus!

24
00:06:37,028-->00:06:41,108
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

25
00:06:41,449-->00:06:45,910
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

26
00:06:46,621-->00:06:49,955
Hold the line! Stay with me!

27
00:06:50,041-->00:06:52,711
If you find yourself alone

28
00:06:52,794-->00:06:55,795
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face

29
00:06:57,048-->00:06:59,171
do not be troubled.

30
00:07:00,010-->00:07:03,675
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

31
00:07:05,807-->00:07:07,467
Brothers

32
00:07:08,852-->00:07:10,679
what we do in life

33
00:07:11,771-->00:07:13,728
echoes in eternity.

34
00:07:21,906-->00:07:23,187
Pull!

35
00:07:38,798-->00:07:40,838
Catapults ready, sir!

36
00:07:51,561-->00:07:53,886
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:53,980-->00:07:56,602
Ignite!

38
00:08:02,614-->00:08:05,283
Archers, draw!

39
00:08:08,787-->00:08:10,115
Loose!

40
00:08:39,359-->00:08:41,517
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:47,117-->00:08:49,026
Hold the line!

42
00:08:57,293-->00:08:59,416
Loose!

43
00:08:59,504-->00:09:00,963
Reload!

44
00:09:05,969-->00:09:07,961
Hold the line!

45
00:09:08,054-->00:09:10,426
Draw!
Loose!

46
00:09:12,976-->00:09:14,767
Stay with me!

47
00:09:20,108-->00:09:22,314
Stay with me!

48
00:09:50,305-->00:09:53,175
Roma victor!

49
00:12:26,211-->00:12:28,203
Roma victor!

50
00:13:10,505-->00:13:13,043
Do you think he's really dying?

51
00:13:13,925-->00:13:15,918
He's been dying for 10 years.

52
00:13:17,345-->00:13:20,346
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

53
00:13:20,432-->00:13:22,341
Maybe he just misses us.

54
00:13:22,434-->00:13:25,103
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if

55
00:13:25,186-->00:13:26,349
Peace, Commodus.

56
00:13:26,438-->00:13:30,482
After two weeks on the road,
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

57
00:13:37,907-->00:13:41,323
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

58
00:13:44,956-->00:13:46,865
He will name me.

59
00:13:49,753-->00:13:53,371
The first thing I shall do when

60
00:13:56,176-->00:13:59,461
Is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

61
00:13:59,554-->00:14:04,382
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

62
00:14:06,144-->00:14:07,887
Your Highness?

63
00:14:11,691-->00:14:14,182
We seem to be almost there, sire.

64
00:14:19,991-->00:14:22,067
Sire.
Where's the Emperor?

65
00:14:22,160-->00:14:25,327
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

66
00:14:25,872-->00:14:28,114
The wounded are still coming in.

67
00:14:28,208-->00:14:29,832
My horse.

68
00:14:29,918-->00:14:31,578
My lord.

69
00:14:35,131-->00:14:36,211
Kiss?

70
00:15:12,085-->00:15:15,584
You have proved your valor yet again,
Maximus.

71
00:15:17,841-->00:15:20,545
Let us hope, for the last time.

72
00:15:20,927-->00:15:23,252
There's no one left to fight, sire.

73
00:15:23,346-->00:15:25,837
There is always someone left to fight.

74
00:15:26,057-->00:15:28,975
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

75
00:15:34,441-->00:15:35,935
Let me go home.

76
00:15:38,570-->00:15:39,768
Home.

77
00:15:58,548-->00:16:00,126
They honor you, Caesar.

78
00:16:00,216-->00:16:03,004
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

79
00:16:25,992-->00:16:28,697
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

80
00:16:30,372-->00:16:32,163
You have missed the war.

81
00:16:32,248-->00:16:34,455
Father, congratulations.

82
00:16:34,918-->00:16:37,325
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

83
00:16:37,420-->00:16:39,080
Save the bulls.

84
00:16:39,172-->00:16:41,628
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

85
00:16:42,050-->00:16:44,375
General.
Highness.

86
00:16:45,387-->00:16:49,005
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

87
00:16:49,099-->00:16:50,890
It has been too long, my old friend.

88
00:16:50,976-->00:16:52,351
Highness.

89
00:16:52,477-->00:16:55,050
Here, Father. Take my arm.

90
00:16:56,648-->00:16:59,851
I think it is time for me to leave.

91
00:17:15,000-->00:17:18,333
So much for the glory of Rome.

92
00:18:47,550-->00:18:49,175
Magnificent battle.

93
00:19:13,118-->00:19:14,826
General. Still alive?

94
00:19:14,911-->00:19:16,192
Still alive.

95
00:19:16,287-->00:19:17,912
The gods must have a sense of humor.

96
00:19:17,998-->00:19:20,667
The gods must love you.
Valerius.

97
00:19:20,750-->00:19:23,537
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

98
00:19:23,670-->00:19:26,790
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

99
00:19:27,424-->00:19:30,757
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

100
00:19:30,844-->00:19:34,426
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

101
00:19:34,514-->00:19:36,637
Here he is.
Highness.

102
00:19:36,725-->00:19:38,883
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

103
00:19:38,977-->00:19:41,931
Beware of Gaius.
He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear

104
00:19:42,022-->00:19:45,521
and you'll wake up one day and all
you'll say is, Republic."

105
00:19:45,608-->00:19:48,278
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

106
00:19:48,361-->00:19:50,983
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

107
00:19:51,072-->00:19:53,563
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

108
00:19:53,658-->00:19:56,280
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

109
00:19:56,369-->00:20:01,197
A soldier has the advantage of being able
to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

110
00:20:01,624-->00:20:05,539
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

111
00:20:05,628-->00:20:08,713
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

112
00:20:18,600-->00:20:20,011
Maximus.

113
00:20:21,144-->00:20:23,600
I'm going to need good men like you.

114
00:20:25,732-->00:20:28,270
How may I be of service, Highness?

115
00:20:28,360-->00:20:30,981
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

116
00:20:31,488-->00:20:34,773
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed,
and the battle is won.

117
00:20:34,866-->00:20:39,658
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

118
00:20:40,205-->00:20:43,159
We must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

119
00:20:43,249-->00:20:46,334
Can I count on you when the time comes?

120
00:20:52,175-->00:20:55,211
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

121
00:20:55,303-->00:20:58,506
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

122
00:21:00,016-->00:21:03,800
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

123
00:21:05,855-->00:21:08,429
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

124
00:21:08,984-->00:21:10,893
She's not forgotten you.

125
00:21:12,195-->00:21:14,318
And now, you're the great man.

126
00:21:26,835-->00:21:29,326
If only you had been born a man

127
00:21:30,422-->00:21:32,663
what a Caesar you would have made.

128
00:21:34,342-->00:21:35,801
Father.

129
00:21:41,641-->00:21:43,634
You would have been strong.

130
00:21:43,727-->00:21:46,930
I wonder, would you have been just?

131
00:21:47,897-->00:21:50,519
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

132
00:21:52,485-->00:21:54,028
How was your journey?

133
00:21:54,112-->00:21:58,276
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

134
00:21:58,450-->00:22:01,071
I need your help. With your brother.

135
00:22:01,703-->00:22:03,197
Of course.

136
00:22:03,288-->00:22:05,446
He loves you. He always has.

137
00:22:06,458-->00:22:07,620
And

138
00:22:09,544-->00:22:12,711
he will need you now, more than ever.

139
00:22:17,761-->00:22:19,634
Enough of politics.

140
00:22:19,971-->00:22:22,972
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter

141
00:22:23,391-->00:22:25,763
and I am a good father.

142
00:22:31,358-->00:22:34,109
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

143
00:22:46,998-->00:22:48,623
Good morning.

144
00:23:01,680-->00:23:04,135
I need three more horses.

145
00:23:14,442-->00:23:16,435
Two! Three!

146
00:23:17,112-->00:23:18,357
Four!

147
00:23:18,446-->00:23:21,116
One! Two!

148
00:23:36,923-->00:23:39,082
You sent for me, Caesar?

149
00:23:43,680-->00:23:46,515
Caesar?
Tell me again, Maximus.

150
00:23:47,600-->00:23:49,308
Why are we here?

151
00:23:50,603-->00:23:53,141
For the glory of the empire, sire.

152
00:23:53,606-->00:23:54,686
Yes.

153
00:23:56,693-->00:23:58,686
Yes, I remember.

154
00:24:01,740-->00:24:03,981
Do you see that map, Maximus?

155
00:24:04,784-->00:24:07,322
That is the world which I created.

156
00:24:08,204-->00:24:09,782
For 25 years

157
00:24:10,373-->00:24:14,241
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

158
00:24:15,628-->00:24:19,460
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

159
00:24:19,549-->00:24:22,005
Four years of peace in 20.

160
00:24:22,302-->00:24:23,796
And for what?

161
00:24:31,227-->00:24:35,011
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

162
00:24:36,316-->00:24:37,596
Caesar, your life

163
00:24:37,692-->00:24:40,266
Please. Please don't call me that.

164
00:24:40,528-->00:24:42,817
Come. Please.

165
00:24:43,615-->00:24:44,990
Come sit.

166
00:24:45,825-->00:24:48,530
Let us talk together now

167
00:24:49,412-->00:24:51,535
very simply, as men.

168
00:24:52,207-->00:24:54,034
Well, Maximus

169
00:24:56,419-->00:24:57,582
talk.

170
00:25:00,548-->00:25:03,419
5,000 of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

171
00:25:03,635-->00:25:07,134
3,000 of them are bloodied and cleaved.
2,000 will never leave this place.

172
00:25:07,222-->00:25:10,258
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

173
00:25:10,350-->00:25:11,974
And what would you believe?

174
00:25:12,060-->00:25:15,892
They fought for you and for Rome.

175
00:25:15,981-->00:25:17,772
And what is Rome, Maximus?

176
00:25:19,943-->00:25:22,350
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

177
00:25:22,445-->00:25:26,443
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

178
00:25:26,533-->00:25:28,442
Yet you have never been there.

179
00:25:28,535-->00:25:30,942
You have not seen what it has become.

180
00:25:31,079-->00:25:34,115
I am dying, Maximus.

181
00:25:34,791-->00:25:36,451
When a man sees his end

182
00:25:36,543-->00:25:39,627
he wants to know there was some purpose
to his life.

183
00:25:40,296-->00:25:43,416
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

184
00:25:43,550-->00:25:45,838
Will I be known as the philosopher?

185
00:25:45,927-->00:25:47,386
The warrior?

186
00:25:47,721-->00:25:49,131
The tyrant?

187
00:25:50,557-->00:25:55,183
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

188
00:25:56,271-->00:25:58,560
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

189
00:25:58,648-->00:26:01,483
You could only whisper it.

190
00:26:01,568-->00:26:04,734
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish

191
00:26:04,821-->00:26:06,564
it was so fragile.

192
00:26:06,906-->00:26:10,607
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

193
00:26:12,120-->00:26:13,579
Maximus

194
00:26:14,497-->00:26:17,415
let us whisper now

195
00:26:17,667-->00:26:19,411
together, you and I.

196
00:26:20,128-->00:26:21,622
You have a son.

197
00:26:23,173-->00:26:25,000
Tell me about your home.

198
00:26:31,222-->00:26:34,093
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

199
00:26:35,518-->00:26:37,262
A very simple place.

200
00:26:37,687-->00:26:40,641
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

201
00:26:40,732-->00:26:44,183
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day

202
00:26:44,944-->00:26:46,854
jasmine in the evening.

203
00:26:48,531-->00:26:51,105
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

204
00:26:51,409-->00:26:54,244
Figs, apples, pears.

205
00:26:54,329-->00:26:58,196
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

206
00:26:59,209-->00:27:01,367
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

207
00:27:01,461-->00:27:03,703
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

208
00:27:03,797-->00:27:05,421
He wants to be one of them.

209
00:27:05,507-->00:27:07,334
When was the last time you were home?

210
00:27:07,425-->00:27:10,510
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

211
00:27:12,138-->00:27:15,424
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

212
00:27:17,143-->00:27:18,851
Worth fighting for.

213
00:27:21,690-->00:27:23,813
There is one more duty

214
00:27:24,359-->00:27:27,111
that I ask of you before you go home.

215
00:27:29,030-->00:27:31,153
What would you have me do, Caesar?

216
00:27:31,241-->00:27:34,859
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

217
00:27:36,037-->00:27:39,038
I will empower you to one end alone

218
00:27:39,582-->00:27:43,082
to give power back to the people of Rome

219
00:27:43,378-->00:27:46,462
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

220
00:27:52,721-->00:27:56,386
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

221
00:27:57,851-->00:27:59,760
With all my heart, no.

222
00:28:02,230-->00:28:03,974
Maximus

223
00:28:04,566-->00:28:07,483
that is why it must be you.

224
00:28:07,569-->00:28:09,645
But surely a prefect, a senator

225
00:28:09,738-->00:28:12,311
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

226
00:28:12,407-->00:28:15,610
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

227
00:28:20,540-->00:28:24,158
And Commodus?
Commodus is not a moral man.

228
00:28:25,045-->00:28:27,583
You have known that since you were young.

229
00:28:27,797-->00:28:29,754
Commodus cannot rule.

230
00:28:29,841-->00:28:32,213
He must not rule.

231
00:28:33,762-->00:28:36,549
You are the son that I should have had.

232
00:28:39,100-->00:28:42,101
Commodus will accept my decision.

233
00:28:44,272-->00:28:49,064
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

234
00:28:54,032-->00:28:55,610
I need some time, sire.

235
00:28:55,700-->00:28:57,159
Yes.

236
00:28:57,243-->00:29:00,826
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

237
00:29:01,873-->00:29:04,031
Now embrace me as my son.

238
00:29:07,462-->00:29:10,167
And bring an old man another blanket.

239
00:29:26,439-->00:29:29,393
My father favors you now.
My lady.

240
00:29:29,484-->00:29:32,520
It was not always so.
Many things change.

241
00:29:32,779-->00:29:35,946
Many things. Not everything.

242
00:29:38,868-->00:29:40,528
Maximus, stop.

243
00:29:44,082-->00:29:45,991
Let me see your face.

244
00:29:48,586-->00:29:51,504
You seem upset.
I lost many men.

245
00:29:52,173-->00:29:54,499
What did my father want with you?

246
00:29:55,593-->00:29:58,547
To wish me well before I leave for home.

247
00:29:59,222-->00:30:00,716
You're lying.

248
00:30:00,807-->00:30:04,390
I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.

249
00:30:04,477-->00:30:07,015
I never acquired your comfort with it.
True.

250
00:30:07,105-->00:30:09,228
But then you never had to.

251
00:30:09,733-->00:30:12,437
Life is more simple for a soldier.

252
00:30:14,237-->00:30:16,443
Or do you think me heartless?

253
00:30:17,449-->00:30:20,200
I think you have a talent for survival.

254
00:30:26,207-->00:30:27,750
Maximus, stop.

255
00:30:30,086-->00:30:32,577
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

256
00:30:32,922-->00:30:35,413
No. I'm tired from battle.

257
00:30:36,051-->00:30:38,968
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

258
00:30:41,973-->00:30:46,053
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

259
00:30:47,562-->00:30:50,978
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

260
00:30:53,109-->00:30:55,268
I will always serve Rome.

261
00:30:57,197-->00:30:59,024
Do you know

262
00:30:59,115-->00:31:01,606
I still remember you in my prayers.

263
00:31:02,661-->00:31:05,531
Oh, yes. I pray.

264
00:31:10,126-->00:31:13,412
I was sad to hear of your husband's death.
I mourned him.

265
00:31:15,298-->00:31:18,133
Thank you.
And I hear you have a son.

266
00:31:19,803-->00:31:22,210
Yes. Lucius.

267
00:31:23,890-->00:31:25,799
He'll be nearly eight years old.

268
00:31:25,892-->00:31:28,134
My son is also nearly eight.

269
00:31:30,939-->00:31:33,311
I thank you for your prayers.

270
00:31:40,865-->00:31:43,487
Ancestors,
I ask for your guidance.

271
00:31:44,786-->00:31:48,321
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

272
00:31:49,916-->00:31:53,700
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son
with a ready sword.

273
00:31:54,921-->00:31:58,207
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

274
00:31:58,925-->00:32:01,084
Ancestors, I honor you

275
00:32:02,304-->00:32:05,589
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

276
00:32:28,496-->00:32:29,872
Cicero.

277
00:32:34,294-->00:32:35,408
Sir.

278
00:32:39,883-->00:32:42,421
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

279
00:32:45,180-->00:32:47,753
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

280
00:32:48,475-->00:32:51,262
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

281
00:32:54,022-->00:32:56,939
We may not be able to go home, after all.

282
00:33:48,034-->00:33:50,821
Are you ready to do your duty
for Rome?

283
00:33:53,999-->00:33:55,374
Yes, Father.

284
00:33:56,501-->00:33:58,577
You will not be emperor.

285
00:34:01,798-->00:34:04,254
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

286
00:34:04,342-->00:34:06,880
My powers will pass to Maximus

287
00:34:08,096-->00:34:09,839
to hold in trust

288
00:34:09,931-->00:34:13,680
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

289
00:34:15,228-->00:34:18,679
Rome is to be a republic again.

290
00:34:20,608-->00:34:23,182
Maximus.
Yes.

291
00:34:29,326-->00:34:31,532
My decision disappoints you?

292
00:34:35,081-->00:34:37,121
You wrote to me once

293
00:34:39,002-->00:34:41,409
listing the four chief virtues:

294
00:34:43,173-->00:34:44,453
Wisdom

295
00:34:44,633-->00:34:46,008
justice

296
00:34:46,217-->00:34:47,676
fortitude

297
00:34:48,053-->00:34:49,844
and temperance.

298
00:34:52,015-->00:34:55,135
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.

299
00:34:56,102-->00:34:58,558
But I have other virtues, Father.

300
00:34:59,773-->00:35:01,101
Ambition.

301
00:35:02,317-->00:35:05,318
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

302
00:35:06,655-->00:35:09,739
Resourcefulness, courage.

303
00:35:10,825-->00:35:15,119
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

304
00:35:16,748-->00:35:19,998
Devotion to my family

305
00:35:21,127-->00:35:22,503
to you.

306
00:35:24,005-->00:35:26,792
But none of my virtues were on your list.

307
00:35:29,052-->00:35:32,219
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

308
00:35:32,472-->00:35:33,800
Commodus

309
00:35:34,724-->00:35:36,384
you go too far.

310
00:35:37,185-->00:35:40,186
I searched the faces of the gods

311
00:35:40,939-->00:35:45,316
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

312
00:35:46,194-->00:35:48,187
One kind word

313
00:35:48,613-->00:35:50,487
one full hug

314
00:35:50,699-->00:35:54,364
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight

315
00:35:55,495-->00:35:59,030
would have been like the sun on my heart
for 1,000 years.

316
00:36:01,710-->00:36:04,331
What is it in me you hate
so much?

317
00:36:04,421-->00:36:05,583
Commodus.

318
00:36:06,673-->00:36:08,796
All I've ever wanted

319
00:36:09,050-->00:36:13,297
was to live up to you, Caesar.

320
00:36:14,597-->00:36:17,171
Father.
Commodus

321
00:36:21,646-->00:36:23,769
your faults as a son

322
00:36:24,733-->00:36:28,018
is my failure as a father.

323
00:36:38,788-->00:36:40,247
Come.

324
00:36:43,835-->00:36:45,294
Father.

325
00:37:00,185-->00:37:02,890
I would butcher the whole world

326
00:37:03,813-->00:37:06,269
if you would only have loved me!

327
00:37:43,770-->00:37:46,854
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

328
00:37:52,487-->00:37:54,314
Lament with me, brother.

329
00:37:55,407-->00:37:57,364
Our great father is dead.

330
00:38:24,102-->00:38:25,810
How did he die?

331
00:38:26,980-->00:38:29,649
The surgeons say
there was no pain.

332
00:38:29,774-->00:38:31,850
His breath gave out as he slept.

333
00:38:41,619-->00:38:42,995
Father.

334
00:38:45,540-->00:38:48,161
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

335
00:38:49,544-->00:38:51,169
Take my hand.

336
00:38:53,882-->00:38:55,709
I only offer it once.

337
00:39:09,898-->00:39:11,309
Quintus.

338
00:40:01,449-->00:40:02,991
Hail, Caesar.

339
00:40:03,910-->00:40:06,531
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

340
00:40:06,621-->00:40:09,195
Wake Gaius and Falco.
Gaius and Falco.

341
00:40:09,290-->00:40:11,532
Sword.

342
00:40:14,045-->00:40:16,916
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

343
00:40:17,007-->00:40:20,043
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

344
00:40:20,260-->00:40:22,881
The Emperor died
of natural causes.

345
00:40:24,514-->00:40:26,756
Why are you armed, Quintus?
Guards!

346
00:40:29,936-->00:40:32,178
Please don't fight, Maximus.

347
00:40:33,898-->00:40:36,187
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

348
00:40:36,651-->00:40:38,478
Ride until dawn

349
00:40:39,696-->00:40:41,238
and then execute him.

350
00:40:41,323-->00:40:43,730
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

351
00:40:44,034-->00:40:46,904
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

352
00:40:48,038-->00:40:50,707
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

353
00:41:15,565-->00:41:16,763
Kneel.

354
00:41:20,362-->00:41:22,687
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.

355
00:41:22,781-->00:41:25,865
Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.

356
00:41:28,536-->00:41:30,862
At least give me a clean death.

357
00:41:32,582-->00:41:34,373
A soldier's death.

358
00:41:55,730-->00:41:58,897
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

359
00:42:19,504-->00:42:20,915
Praetorian!

360
00:43:40,585-->00:43:42,578
When was the last time
you were home?

361
00:43:42,671-->00:43:45,707
Two years,
264 days and this morning.

362
00:43:47,217-->00:43:49,174
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son

363
00:43:49,260-->00:43:51,586
I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

364
00:43:51,680-->00:43:54,087
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

365
00:43:54,182-->00:43:56,755
with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.

366
00:43:56,851-->00:43:59,852
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

367
00:43:59,938-->00:44:02,227
For all else is dust and air.

368
00:45:02,500-->00:45:04,493
Papa!

369
00:47:48,583-->00:47:50,077
Don't die.

370
00:47:56,424-->00:47:58,500
You'll meet them again.

371
00:48:00,136-->00:48:01,417
Not yet.

372
00:48:10,021-->00:48:13,770
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

373
00:48:48,143-->00:48:49,518
Don't die.

374
00:48:50,312-->00:48:52,684
They'll feed you to the lions.

375
00:48:52,814-->00:48:55,056
They are worth more than we are.

376
00:49:05,076-->00:49:06,535
Better now?

377
00:49:07,662-->00:49:09,571
Clean. You see?

378
00:49:40,278-->00:49:43,113
Proximo! My old friend.

379
00:49:44,532-->00:49:47,569
Every day is a great day when you are here

380
00:49:48,036-->00:49:52,199
but today is your most fortunate day.

381
00:49:54,876-->00:49:58,577
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

382
00:49:59,214-->00:50:03,081
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

383
00:50:04,386-->00:50:07,303
You sold me queer giraffes.

384
00:50:08,223-->00:50:10,892
I want my money back.
Not a chance.

385
00:50:14,479-->00:50:17,848
I do special price for you.
On what?

386
00:50:19,401-->00:50:22,318
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

387
00:50:36,251-->00:50:39,086
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

388
00:50:39,170-->00:50:41,792
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

389
00:50:42,007-->00:50:44,332
You need both, I think.

390
00:50:44,426-->00:50:45,624
Get up.

391
00:50:53,643-->00:50:55,470
What's your trade?

392
00:50:55,937-->00:50:57,266
I was a hunter.

393
00:50:57,355-->00:51:01,020
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

394
00:51:01,818-->00:51:03,193
Sit down.

395
00:51:07,073-->00:51:08,318
Mark of the legion.

396
00:51:09,617-->00:51:12,737
Deserter.
Maybe so, but who cares?

397
00:51:12,829-->00:51:13,944
He's a Spaniard.

398
00:51:14,039-->00:51:15,948
I'll take six. For 1,000.

399
00:51:16,041-->00:51:19,623
One thousand?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

400
00:51:19,711-->00:51:21,704
These slaves are rotten.

401
00:51:21,796-->00:51:24,963
It all adds to the flavor. No, wait!

402
00:51:25,508-->00:51:27,216
I can negotiate.

403
00:51:28,303-->00:51:32,383
I'll give you 2,000, and 4,000 for the beasts.

404
00:51:32,557-->00:51:34,716
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

405
00:51:52,327-->00:51:55,530
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

406
00:51:55,830-->00:51:57,740
I am Proximo.

407
00:51:58,333-->00:52:01,002
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days

408
00:52:01,086-->00:52:03,327
which will be the last
of your miserable lives

409
00:52:03,421-->00:52:07,419
than that bitch of a mother
that brought you screaming into this world.

410
00:52:08,051-->00:52:11,384
I did not pay good money for you
for your company.

411
00:52:12,555-->00:52:15,759
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

412
00:52:16,518-->00:52:20,266
And as your mother was there
at your beginning

413
00:52:21,272-->00:52:23,894
so I shall be there at your end.

414
00:52:25,443-->00:52:28,397
And when you die, and die you shall

415
00:52:29,364-->00:52:32,281
your transition shall be to the sound of

416
00:52:36,955-->00:52:38,414
Gladiators

417
00:52:39,582-->00:52:41,077
I salute you.

418
00:52:45,880-->00:52:47,125
Red.

419
00:52:50,552-->00:52:51,880
Yellow.

420
00:52:53,054-->00:52:54,299
Yellow.

421
00:53:05,066-->00:53:06,264
Good.

422
00:53:06,943-->00:53:08,106
Red.

423
00:53:13,241-->00:53:14,570
Spaniard.

424
00:53:47,942-->00:53:50,268
That's enough for the moment!

425
00:53:50,612-->00:53:52,189
His time will come.

426
00:53:55,200-->00:53:56,279
Next.

427
00:54:09,673-->00:54:10,953
Spaniard

428
00:54:12,467-->00:54:14,294
why don't you fight?

429
00:54:14,636-->00:54:16,130
We all have to fight.

430
00:54:16,221-->00:54:18,130
Well, I don't fight.

431
00:54:18,556-->00:54:21,807
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words

432
00:54:21,893-->00:54:23,802
and speak seven languages.

433
00:54:23,895-->00:54:25,093
Good.

434
00:54:25,814-->00:54:28,850
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

435
00:54:37,158-->00:54:40,741
Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.

436
00:54:41,496-->00:54:42,741
Freedom?

437
00:54:43,873-->00:54:45,665
What do I have to do?

438
00:54:46,084-->00:54:48,373
You go in the arena and you kill me.

439
00:54:48,503-->00:54:49,878
And him

440
00:54:50,839-->00:54:52,381
and the Numidian

441
00:54:52,674-->00:54:54,216
and the deserter.

442
00:54:55,844-->00:54:57,338
And 100 more.

443
00:54:57,429-->00:55:00,180
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

444
00:55:00,849-->00:55:02,592
I can't do that.

445
00:55:03,685-->00:55:04,848
No?

446
00:55:11,109-->00:55:12,520
But I can.

447
00:55:28,043-->00:55:30,249
Is that the sign of your gods?

448
00:55:35,467-->00:55:37,543
Will that not anger them?

449
00:55:58,907-->00:56:00,567
The gods favor you.

450
00:56:00,909-->00:56:03,067
Red is the gods' color.

451
00:56:04,454-->00:56:06,660
You will need their help today.

452
00:56:45,996-->00:56:47,620
Proximo!

453
00:56:52,961-->00:56:55,119
Still leading with the German?

454
00:56:55,213-->00:56:57,336
The crowd love a barbarian.

455
00:56:57,799-->00:56:59,708
Besides that, he's making me rich.

456
00:56:59,801-->00:57:02,374
Has that Numidian fought before?

457
00:57:03,221-->00:57:04,799
No, first time.

458
00:57:04,889-->00:57:07,843
And that one, laborer, soldier?

459
00:57:08,310-->00:57:12,639
He's a Spaniard. He might as well
be a eunuch, for what he brings to the ring.

460
00:57:13,648-->00:57:17,860
Five hundred sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

461
00:57:17,986-->00:57:21,651
And 1,000,
that the Numidian makes it through alone.

462
00:57:23,199-->00:57:26,319
Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?

463
00:57:28,163-->00:57:29,491
It's unethical.

464
00:57:29,706-->00:57:31,580
What if I make it 2,000?

465
00:57:45,930-->00:57:48,931
Some of you are thinking you won't fight

466
00:57:50,226-->00:57:52,219
some that you can't fight.

467
00:57:53,021-->00:57:56,520
They all say that until they're out there.

468
00:57:59,194-->00:58:00,392
Listen.

469
00:58:01,196-->00:58:03,865
Kill!

470
00:58:10,455-->00:58:13,207
Thrust this into another man's flesh

471
00:58:13,583-->00:58:16,252
and they will applaud and love you for that.

472
00:58:16,378-->00:58:17,753
And you

473
00:58:19,756-->00:58:21,713
you may begin to love them

474
00:58:22,550-->00:58:23,926
for that.

475
00:58:28,139-->00:58:31,639
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

476
00:58:34,104-->00:58:36,392
Sadly, we cannot choose how

477
00:58:37,524-->00:58:40,275
but we can decide how we meet that end

478
00:58:41,319-->00:58:43,810
in order that we are remembered

479
00:58:45,782-->00:58:46,945
as men.

480
00:58:47,033-->00:58:48,112
Come on!

481
00:58:51,121-->00:58:53,493
On the left, draw your shields!

482
00:58:54,457-->00:58:56,829
On the right, draw your swords!

483
00:58:57,502-->00:58:59,578
Kill! Kill!

484
00:59:00,797-->00:59:03,169
Pair them up: Red with yellow.

485
00:59:08,263-->00:59:09,425
Next!

486
00:59:15,312-->00:59:16,510
Move!

487
01:02:3633,510-->01:02:3634,708
Usurper!

488
01:02:3657,492-->01:03:3600,612
Go away!
You'll never rule us, Commodus!

489
01:03:3630,567-->01:03:3635,276
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?

490
01:03:3635,572-->01:03:3637,861
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

491
01:03:3638,074-->01:03:3640,233
I think he could do very well.

492
01:03:3640,744-->01:03:3642,783
For Rome, or for you?

493
01:03:3648,960-->01:03:3652,294
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

494
01:03:3658,553-->01:04:3600,546
Lucius!
Mother!

495
01:04:3602,766-->01:04:3604,260
Hail, Caesar.

496
01:04:3604,476-->01:04:3605,970
Senators.

497
01:04:3609,648-->01:04:3612,565
Rome greets her new emperor.

498
01:04:3612,651-->01:04:3616,150
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

499
01:04:3616,279-->01:04:3618,106
Thank you, Falco.

500
01:04:3618,239-->01:04:3622,284
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

501
01:04:3622,369-->01:04:3624,408
Caesar.
Gracchus.

502
01:04:3624,496-->01:04:3626,951
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

503
01:04:3627,040-->01:04:3630,243
There are many matters
that require your attention.

504
01:04:3633,004-->01:04:3635,839
To order, please. To order.

505
01:04:3636,341-->01:04:3640,967
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols

506
01:04:3641,096-->01:04:3644,132
to begin addressing the many problems
in the city

507
01:04:3644,265-->01:04:3648,310
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter

508
01:04:3648,853-->01:04:3652,139
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

509
01:04:3652,524-->01:04:3654,315
So, if Caesar

510
01:04:3656,486-->01:04:3658,360
Don't you see, Gracchus?

511
01:04:3659,781-->01:05:3602,106
That's the very problem, isn't it?

512
01:05:3602,492-->01:05:3605,410
My father spent all his time
at study

513
01:05:3606,955-->01:05:3610,324
at books of learning and philosophy.

514
01:05:3611,334-->01:05:3615,284
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

515
01:05:3615,797-->01:05:3618,964
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

516
01:05:3619,634-->01:05:3621,793
But the Senate is the people, sire

517
01:05:3621,886-->01:05:3625,386
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

518
01:05:3626,016-->01:05:3629,634
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

519
01:05:3630,478-->01:05:3632,969
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

520
01:05:3633,064-->01:05:3635,187
I think I understand my own people.

521
01:05:3635,275-->01:05:3638,726
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us

522
01:05:3639,070-->01:05:3641,692
out of his own extensive experience.

523
01:05:3645,660-->01:05:3647,202
I call it love.

524
01:05:3647,704-->01:05:3650,871
I am their father.
The people are my children.

525
01:05:3651,166-->01:05:3653,787
I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

526
01:05:3653,877-->01:05:3656,913
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

527
01:06:3603,511-->01:06:3606,085
No, but if you interrupt me again

528
01:06:3607,599-->01:06:3608,974
I assure you that you shall.

529
01:06:3609,059-->01:06:3611,384
Senator, my brother is very tired.

530
01:06:3612,395-->01:06:3616,559
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

531
01:06:3617,108-->01:06:3622,066
My lady, as always,
your lightest touch commands obedience.

532
01:06:3629,204-->01:06:3631,529
Who are they to lecture me?

533
01:06:3631,748-->01:06:3634,239
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

534
01:06:3634,376-->01:06:3637,246
What uses? All they do is talk.

535
01:06:3638,421-->01:06:3643,048
It should be just you and me and Rome.

536
01:06:3643,134-->01:06:3646,420
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

537
01:06:3646,930-->01:06:3648,590
Rome has changed.

538
01:06:3648,682-->01:06:3651,718
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

539
01:06:3652,060-->01:06:3653,934
Of course, but leave the people their

540
01:06:3654,020-->01:06:3655,562
Illusions?

541
01:06:3657,148-->01:06:3658,607
Traditions.

542
01:06:3659,442-->01:07:3602,277
My father's war against the barbarians

543
01:07:3602,821-->01:07:3606,486
He said it himself: It achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

544
01:07:3606,574-->01:07:3608,484
The people always love victories.

545
01:07:3608,576-->01:07:3612,242
Why? They didn't see the battles.

546
01:07:3613,581-->01:07:3615,574
What do they care about Germania?

547
01:07:3615,667-->01:07:3617,956
They care about the greatness of Rome.

548
01:07:3618,044-->01:07:3619,953
"The greatness of Rome."

549
01:07:3621,923-->01:07:3623,667
Well, what is that?

550
01:07:3626,428-->01:07:3629,631
It's an idea. Greatness.

551
01:07:3633,435-->01:07:3636,886
Greatness is a vision.
Exactly. A vision.

552
01:07:3638,940-->01:07:3640,814
Do you not see, Lucilla?

553
01:07:3642,193-->01:07:3646,143
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they'll love me for it.

554
01:07:3646,823-->01:07:3651,200
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

555
01:08:3602,630-->01:08:3605,964
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

556
01:08:3657,185-->01:09:3600,305
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

557
01:09:3608,363-->01:09:3609,526
Games.

558
01:09:3611,866-->01:09:3614,903
One hundred and fifty days of games.

559
01:09:3615,370-->01:09:3617,030
He's cleverer than I thought.

560
01:09:3617,122-->01:09:3620,621
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him

561
01:09:3621,376-->01:09:3623,618
if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.

562
01:09:3623,712-->01:09:3626,547
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

563
01:09:3627,924-->01:09:3631,044
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

564
01:09:3631,136-->01:09:3634,220
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

565
01:09:3634,931-->01:09:3638,051
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

566
01:09:3638,643-->01:09:3641,893
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

567
01:09:3642,480-->01:09:3646,893
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

568
01:09:3646,985-->01:09:3648,977
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

569
01:09:3650,905-->01:09:3652,945
He'll bring them death

570
01:09:3654,743-->01:09:3657,068
and they will love him for it.

571
01:10:3619,809-->01:10:3621,849
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

572
01:10:3621,936-->01:10:3624,344
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

573
01:10:3624,439-->01:10:3626,515
We want them to keep coming back.

574
01:10:3626,608-->01:10:3630,771
So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

575
01:10:3633,365-->01:10:3634,693
Spaniard.

576
01:10:3642,540-->01:10:3644,035
So entertain!

577
01:11:3649,190-->01:11:3653,271
Are you not entertained?

578
01:11:3655,613-->01:11:3657,855
Is this not why you're here?

579
01:12:3602,454-->01:12:3604,861
Spaniard!

580
01:12:3622,724-->01:12:3624,467
What do you want?

581
01:12:3627,062-->01:12:3628,224
Girl?

582
01:12:3629,272-->01:12:3630,387
Boy?

583
01:12:3631,316-->01:12:3633,558
You sent for me.
Yes, I did.

584
01:12:3634,653-->01:12:3637,737
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

585
01:12:3637,822-->01:12:3639,233
You could be magnificent.

586
01:12:3639,324-->01:12:3642,574
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

587
01:12:3643,411-->01:12:3646,496
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

588
01:12:3649,918-->01:12:3653,785
The young emperor
has arranged a series of spectacles

589
01:12:3653,922-->01:12:3658,085
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

590
01:12:3658,593-->01:13:3600,586
I find that amusing

591
01:13:3600,929-->01:13:3603,965
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise

592
01:13:3604,099-->01:13:3607,515
the all knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

593
01:13:3610,522-->01:13:3614,650
So finally,
after five years of scratching a living

594
01:13:3614,776-->01:13:3616,934
in flea infested villages

595
01:13:3617,028-->01:13:3620,113
we're finally going back to where we belong:

596
01:13:3620,824-->01:13:3622,366
The Colosseum.

597
01:13:3624,619-->01:13:3627,406
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

598
01:13:3628,748-->01:13:3630,824
Fifty thousand Romans

599
01:13:3631,751-->01:13:3635,583
watching every movement of your sword

600
01:13:3637,007-->01:13:3639,462
willing you to make that killer blow.

601
01:13:3640,677-->01:13:3644,342
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

602
01:13:3645,307-->01:13:3648,925
It rises. It rises up

603
01:13:3650,478-->01:13:3652,103
like a storm.

604
01:13:3652,564-->01:13:3654,971
As if you were the thunder god himself.

605
01:13:3655,275-->01:13:3658,276
You were a gladiator?
Yes, I was.

606
01:14:3604,701-->01:14:3606,777
You won your freedom?

607
01:14:3606,953-->01:14:3609,361
A long time ago, the Emperor

608
01:14:3610,999-->01:14:3613,157
presented me with a rudius.

609
01:14:3614,919-->01:14:3616,746
It's just a wooden sword.

610
01:14:3617,589-->01:14:3619,831
The symbol of your freedom.

611
01:14:3622,010-->01:14:3625,046
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

612
01:14:3626,389-->01:14:3628,797
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

613
01:14:3628,892-->01:14:3632,724
I did not say I knew him.
I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

614
01:14:3633,772-->01:14:3635,930
You asked me what I want.

615
01:14:3637,192-->01:14:3640,146
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor

616
01:14:3641,404-->01:14:3642,815
as you did.

617
01:14:3642,906-->01:14:3646,322
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

618
01:14:3647,202-->01:14:3650,286
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

619
01:14:3651,456-->01:14:3654,125
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

620
01:14:3655,251-->01:14:3658,537
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

621
01:15:3603,009-->01:15:3604,883
I will win the crowd.

622
01:15:3607,138-->01:15:3610,175
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

623
01:15:3611,601-->01:15:3614,721
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together

624
01:15:3615,271-->01:15:3617,063
and have bloody adventures.

625
01:15:3617,148-->01:15:3619,141
And the great whore
will suckle us

626
01:15:3619,234-->01:15:3621,641
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

627
01:15:3621,736-->01:15:3623,147
And then

628
01:15:3624,280-->01:15:3626,403
when enough men have died

629
01:15:3628,576-->01:15:3631,032
perhaps you will have your freedom.

630
01:15:3635,458-->01:15:3637,830
Here. Use this.

631
01:16:3601,526-->01:16:3604,693
It's somewhere out there, my country.

632
01:16:3605,780-->01:16:3607,061
My home.

633
01:16:3608,283-->01:16:3610,406
My wife is preparing food.

634
01:16:3611,411-->01:16:3614,116
My daughters carry water from the river.

635
01:16:3615,457-->01:16:3617,496
Will I ever see them again?

636
01:16:3618,752-->01:16:3620,294
I think, no.

637
01:16:3620,587-->01:16:3623,042
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

638
01:16:3623,131-->01:16:3624,542
I think so.

639
01:16:3625,133-->01:16:3628,217
But then, I will die soon.

640
01:16:3629,846-->01:16:3632,302
They will not die for many years.

641
01:16:3633,099-->01:16:3634,759
I'll have to wait.

642
01:16:3634,851-->01:16:3637,057
But you would? Wait?

643
01:16:3637,687-->01:16:3639,016
Of course.

644
01:16:3640,940-->01:16:3642,316
You see

645
01:16:3643,485-->01:16:3644,860
my wife

646
01:16:3646,363-->01:16:3650,277
and my son are already waiting for me.

647
01:16:3651,034-->01:16:3654,652
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

648
01:16:3658,750-->01:17:3600,078
Not yet.

649
01:17:3601,670-->01:17:3603,128
Unless
Not yet.

650
01:17:3607,342-->01:17:3608,421
Not yet.

651
01:17:3621,815-->01:17:3623,095
There he is.

652
01:18:3612,240-->01:18:3613,355
Out.

653
01:18:3614,576-->01:18:3616,485
Move, go, out!

654
01:18:3629,215-->01:18:3631,789
Good to see you again,
old friend.

655
01:18:3637,057-->01:18:3638,765
Bring me fortune.

656
01:18:3643,355-->01:18:3646,225
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

657
01:18:3647,317-->01:18:3649,890
I didn't know men could build such things.

658
01:18:3659,871-->01:19:3601,413
Win the crowd.

659
01:19:3601,665-->01:19:3603,906
Get inside. Move.

660
01:19:3604,084-->01:19:3605,364
Inside.

661
01:19:3654,592-->01:19:3657,297
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

662
01:20:3600,265-->01:20:3602,341
Come, brother. It's late.

663
01:20:3605,937-->01:20:3608,855
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

664
01:20:3611,568-->01:20:3614,901
That is what Gracchus and his friends
don't understand.

665
01:20:3615,322-->01:20:3618,607
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

666
01:20:3625,623-->01:20:3628,328
Commodus, drink this tonic.

667
01:20:3637,927-->01:20:3640,549
I think the time is almost right.

668
01:20:3640,680-->01:20:3643,551
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate

669
01:20:3643,725-->01:20:3645,801
at the celebration to honor our father.

670
01:20:3645,894-->01:20:3647,970
Do you think I should?

671
01:20:3648,605-->01:20:3650,644
Are the people ready?

672
01:20:3652,651-->01:20:3655,023
I think you need your rest now.

673
01:21:3600,992-->01:21:3602,784
Will you stay with me?

674
01:21:3602,869-->01:21:3605,277
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

675
01:21:3612,045-->01:21:3613,243
Still.

676
01:21:3615,090-->01:21:3616,370
Always.

677
01:21:3618,093-->01:21:3620,963
Stay with me tonight.
You know I won't.

678
01:21:3625,475-->01:21:3626,969
Then kiss me.

679
01:21:3635,777-->01:21:3637,355
Sleep, brother.

680
01:22:3630,123-->01:22:3632,246
Having servants who are deaf and mute

681
01:22:3632,334-->01:22:3635,085
at least ensures I live a little longer.

682
01:22:3636,880-->01:22:3639,205
They're arresting scholars now.

683
01:22:3639,299-->01:22:3643,131
Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

684
01:22:3643,762-->01:22:3645,671
And mathematicians.

685
01:22:3646,890-->01:22:3649,048
And all to feed the arena.

686
01:22:3650,685-->01:22:3653,223
The Senate did not approve martial law.

687
01:22:3653,313-->01:22:3656,516
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

688
01:22:3657,192-->01:22:3659,315
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

689
01:22:3659,402-->01:23:3602,854
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

690
01:23:3603,073-->01:23:3607,735
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

691
01:23:3609,120-->01:23:3613,498
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myself with.

692
01:23:3614,292-->01:23:3617,210
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed

693
01:23:3617,295-->01:23:3620,130
planning the festival to honor your father.

694
01:23:3620,215-->01:23:3623,797
He neglects even the most fundamental task
of government.

695
01:23:3624,552-->01:23:3626,759
So just what is he planning?

696
01:23:3627,138-->01:23:3628,763
And what pays for it?

697
01:23:3628,848-->01:23:3633,060
These daily games are costing a fortune,
yet we have no new taxes.

698
01:23:3633,812-->01:23:3635,222
The future.

699
01:23:3636,648-->01:23:3638,640
The future pays for it.

700
01:23:3640,110-->01:23:3642,648
He's started selling the grain reserves.

701
01:23:3643,113-->01:23:3644,939
This can't be true.

702
01:23:3645,532-->01:23:3648,283
He's selling
Rome's reserves of grain.

703
01:23:3648,618-->01:23:3651,536
The people will be starving in two years.

704
01:23:3652,080-->01:23:3653,574
I hope they're enjoying the games

705
01:23:3653,665-->01:23:3657,034
because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.

706
01:23:3657,377-->01:23:3659,702
Rome must know this.
And how?

707
01:24:3600,213-->01:24:3602,585
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

708
01:24:3603,174-->01:24:3606,709
And who will tell them before it's too late?
You, Gracchus?

709
01:24:3608,096-->01:24:3609,590
You, Gaius.

710
01:24:3609,681-->01:24:3613,679
Will you make a speech on the floor
of the Senate, denouncing my brother?

711
01:24:3613,768-->01:24:3616,306
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

712
01:24:3617,314-->01:24:3618,642
Who'd dare?

713
01:24:3627,824-->01:24:3630,825
I have been living
in a prison of fear every day

714
01:24:3630,910-->01:24:3633,532
because my son is heir to the throne.

715
01:24:3639,169-->01:24:3640,627
He must die.

716
01:24:3645,008-->01:24:3648,756
Quintus and the Praetorians
would simply seize control for themselves.

717
01:24:3648,845-->01:24:3652,677
No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.

718
01:24:3652,766-->01:24:3654,842
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

719
01:24:3654,934-->01:24:3659,063
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.

720
01:25:3600,607-->01:25:3602,101
So we do nothing?

721
01:25:3602,192-->01:25:3604,979
No, child. We keep our counsel.

722
01:25:3605,945-->01:25:3607,356
We prepare.

723
01:25:3608,198-->01:25:3612,943
As long as the people support him,
we are voices without steel.

724
01:25:3613,745-->01:25:3615,156
We are air.

725
01:25:3618,208-->01:25:3620,959
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

726
01:25:3621,044-->01:25:3623,914
One day,
he'll have more enemies than friends.

727
01:25:3624,339-->01:25:3627,293
And on that day, we will act.

728
01:25:3627,884-->01:25:3629,758
Then we will strike.

729
01:25:3630,679-->01:25:3632,422
But until then

730
01:25:3633,598-->01:25:3635,140
we are docile.

731
01:25:3635,642-->01:25:3637,800
We are obedient.

732
01:25:3639,396-->01:25:3641,388
And we are treacherous.

733
01:25:3650,031-->01:25:3651,276
Come on!

734
01:26:3600,041-->01:26:3602,081
All right, that's enough.

735
01:26:3624,649-->01:26:3628,398
The Emperor wants battles, and I don't want
to sacrifice my best fighters.

736
01:26:3628,486-->01:26:3631,653
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

737
01:26:3631,740-->01:26:3635,322
You get the battle of Carthage.
Massacre of Carthage.

738
01:26:3636,911-->01:26:3640,779
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,
round up all the beggars and thieves?

739
01:26:3640,874-->01:26:3642,036
We've done that.

740
01:26:3642,125-->01:26:3645,743
If you want to give away the best gladiators
in the whole of the empire

741
01:26:3645,837-->01:26:3647,960
then I want double the rates.

742
01:26:3648,048-->01:26:3651,796
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract cancelled.

743
01:26:3651,885-->01:26:3653,344
You don't like it?

744
01:26:3653,428-->01:26:3657,378
Then you can crawl back
down that shit hole that you came from.

745
01:27:3600,477-->01:27:3602,849
Cassius, please. You can free us.

746
01:27:3632,509-->01:27:3635,510
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

747
01:27:3635,679-->01:27:3636,793
Yes.

748
01:27:3637,597-->01:27:3639,756
They said you were a giant.

749
01:27:3639,891-->01:27:3643,011
They said you could crush a man's skull
with one hand.

750
01:27:3643,144-->01:27:3644,888
A man's? No.

751
01:27:3646,231-->01:27:3647,511
A boy's.

752
01:27:3649,567-->01:27:3653,102
Do they have good horses in Spain?
Some of the best.

753
01:27:3654,155-->01:27:3657,240
This is Argento and this is Scarto.

754
01:27:3658,618-->01:28:3600,445
They were my horses.

755
01:28:3601,371-->01:28:3603,447
They were taken from me.

756
01:28:3603,748-->01:28:3607,034
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

757
01:28:3607,585-->01:28:3610,919
They let you watch the games?
My uncle says it makes me strong.

758
01:28:3611,006-->01:28:3614,291
And what does your father say?
My father is dead.

759
01:28:3616,094-->01:28:3618,134
Master Lucius, it is time.

760
01:28:3619,431-->01:28:3620,759
I have to go.

761
01:28:3620,849-->01:28:3622,426
Your name is Lucius?

762
01:28:3624,561-->01:28:3627,230
Lucius Verus, after my father.

763
01:28:3657,844-->01:28:3659,587
Lower!

764
01:29:3604,726-->01:29:3606,185
Claudius!

765
01:29:3606,436-->01:29:3608,844
Yes?
More shields!

766
01:29:3608,938-->01:29:3610,481
All right.

767
01:29:3629,250-->01:29:3633,996
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him

768
01:29:3634,089-->01:29:3636,165
and then speak together.

769
01:29:3636,925-->01:29:3640,424
Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.

770
01:29:3641,513-->01:29:3644,383
Go, and die with honor.

771
01:30:3639,446-->01:30:3641,522
Hail, mighty Caesar!

772
01:30:3644,743-->01:30:3648,990
Caesar!

773
01:30:3652,042-->01:30:3654,996
We who are about to die
salute you!

774
01:30:3656,713-->01:30:3658,421
On this day

775
01:30:3659,007-->01:31:3602,043
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

776
01:31:3602,927-->01:31:3606,546
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall

777
01:31:3606,640-->01:31:3608,716
of mighty Carthage!

778
01:31:3612,395-->01:31:3616,773
On the barren plain of Zama

779
01:31:3617,442-->01:31:3620,443
there stood the invincible armies

780
01:31:3620,904-->01:31:3623,525
of the barbarian Hannibal.

781
01:31:3624,240-->01:31:3627,407
Ferocious mercenaries
and warriors

782
01:31:3627,494-->01:31:3629,866
from all brute nations

783
01:31:3629,954-->01:31:3634,248
bent on merciless destruction

784
01:31:3635,126-->01:31:3636,455
conquest.

785
01:31:3637,420-->01:31:3641,465
Your emperor is pleased to give you

786
01:31:3641,549-->01:31:3644,634
the barbarian horde!

787
01:31:3652,978-->01:31:3654,935
Anyone here been in the army?

788
01:31:3655,021-->01:31:3657,975
Yes. I served with you
at Vindobona.

789
01:31:3658,900-->01:32:3600,442
You can help me.

790
01:32:3601,820-->01:32:3604,108
Whatever comes out of these gates

791
01:32:3605,156-->01:32:3608,490
we've got a better chance of survival
if we work together.

792
01:32:3608,994-->01:32:3610,737
Do you understand?

793
01:32:3612,831-->01:32:3614,907
If we stay together, we survive.

794
01:32:3615,000-->01:32:3618,119
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires

795
01:32:3618,211-->01:32:3621,794
of Scipio Africanus!

796
01:32:3632,600-->01:32:3634,308
To the death!

797
01:32:3638,106-->01:32:3640,679
Kill!

798
01:32:3644,529-->01:32:3646,154
Stay close.

799
01:32:3652,120-->01:32:3653,994
Come together!

800
01:32:3655,332-->01:32:3659,376
Stay close. Staggered columns!

801
01:33:3612,223-->01:33:3614,133
You don't have a chance.

802
01:33:3625,987-->01:33:3628,525
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

803
01:33:3630,033-->01:33:3631,575
Hold!

804
01:33:3633,745-->01:33:3636,662
Hold! As one!

805
01:33:3639,584-->01:33:3640,913
Well done.

806
01:33:3652,764-->01:33:3656,596
Hold. Down low!

807
01:34:3602,440-->01:34:3603,603
Yes!

808
01:34:3615,745-->01:34:3616,943
Hagen!

809
01:34:3641,104-->01:34:3644,639
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

810
01:34:3648,278-->01:34:3649,653
Quickly!

811
01:34:3650,322-->01:34:3653,073
Get out there.
Hurry!

812
01:35:3634,282-->01:35:3635,480
Maximus!

813
01:35:3647,671-->01:35:3650,043
Single column!

814
01:36:3635,385-->01:36:3636,760
We win!

815
01:36:3642,183-->01:36:3644,721
My history's a little hazy, Cassius

816
01:36:3645,520-->01:36:3648,438
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

817
01:36:3648,523-->01:36:3650,266
Yes, sire.

818
01:36:3652,235-->01:36:3653,564
Forgive me, sire.

819
01:36:3653,653-->01:36:3656,358
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

820
01:36:3657,115-->01:36:3658,278
Who is he?

821
01:36:3658,366-->01:37:3601,367
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

822
01:37:3603,872-->01:37:3605,699
I think I'll meet him.

823
01:37:3605,874-->01:37:3607,249
Yes, sire.

824
01:37:3609,419-->01:37:3611,293
Hail to the barbarians!

825
01:37:3626,269-->01:37:3629,638
Forward! Arms at ready!

826
01:37:3643,244-->01:37:3644,904
Drop your weapons.

827
01:37:3648,917-->01:37:3651,834
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

828
01:37:3652,504-->01:37:3654,627
I am at the Emperor's service.

829
01:38:3621,366-->01:38:3623,524
Rise.

830
01:38:3633,044-->01:38:3635,120
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

831
01:38:3635,213-->01:38:3637,882
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator
to match you.

832
01:38:3637,966-->01:38:3640,753
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

833
01:38:3640,844-->01:38:3642,386
Or was it Hercules?

834
01:38:3643,805-->01:38:3647,554
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

835
01:38:3649,686-->01:38:3651,310
You do have a name.

836
01:38:3652,063-->01:38:3653,972
My name is Gladiator.

837
01:38:3657,235-->01:39:3600,402
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

838
01:39:3601,740-->01:39:3605,073
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

839
01:39:3616,921-->01:39:3619,412
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius

840
01:39:3619,758-->01:39:3621,715
commander of the armies of the north

841
01:39:3621,801-->01:39:3624,257
general of the Felix Legions

842
01:39:3624,346-->01:39:3627,596
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius

843
01:39:3628,933-->01:39:3631,092
father to a murdered son

844
01:39:3631,603-->01:39:3633,892
husband to a murdered wife

845
01:39:3634,272-->01:39:3637,937
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

846
01:39:3644,949-->01:39:3646,360
Arms!

847
01:39:3659,464-->01:40:3602,798
Live!

848
01:40:3650,098-->01:40:3652,803
Arms, at rest!

849
01:41:3645,236-->01:41:3649,733
Maximus!

850
01:42:3637,789-->01:42:3639,034
Father.

851
01:43:3653,365-->01:43:3655,322
Why is he still alive?

852
01:43:3656,534-->01:43:3658,029
I don't know.

853
01:43:3658,536-->01:44:3600,161
He shouldn't be alive.

854
01:44:3600,955-->01:44:3602,366
It vexes me.

855
01:44:3604,125-->01:44:3605,869
I'm terribly vexed.

856
01:44:3617,055-->01:44:3619,048
I did what I had to do.

857
01:44:3619,808-->01:44:3623,852
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

858
01:44:3623,937-->01:44:3625,561
You do see that.

859
01:44:3625,981-->01:44:3627,143
Yes.

860
01:44:3631,903-->01:44:3635,189
What did you feel when you saw him?

861
01:44:3637,242-->01:44:3638,902
I felt nothing.

862
01:44:3640,870-->01:44:3643,408
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

863
01:44:3644,416-->01:44:3646,657
No more than I wounded him.

864
01:44:3651,214-->01:44:3653,420
They lied to me in Germania.

865
01:44:3655,093-->01:44:3657,169
They told me he was dead.

866
01:44:3659,180-->01:45:3601,754
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

867
01:45:3601,891-->01:45:3605,177
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

868
01:45:3606,521-->01:45:3608,893
Then you must let the legions know

869
01:45:3608,982-->01:45:3612,102
their treachery will not go unpunished.

870
01:45:3612,944-->01:45:3614,569
Poor sister.

871
01:45:3614,779-->01:45:3617,235
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

872
01:45:3618,450-->01:45:3620,193
What will you do?

873
01:45:3633,131-->01:45:3634,459
This way.

874
01:46:3609,918-->01:46:3613,334
Rich matrons pay well
to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

875
01:46:3613,421-->01:46:3615,912
I knew your brother would send assassins.

876
01:46:3616,424-->01:46:3619,046
I didn't realize he would send his best.

877
01:46:3620,679-->01:46:3622,755
Maximus, he doesn't know.

878
01:46:3623,723-->01:46:3626,926
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

879
01:46:3627,018-->01:46:3629,556
I knew nothing
Don't lie to me!

880
01:46:3635,944-->01:46:3637,604
I wept for them.

881
01:46:3637,779-->01:46:3641,611
As you wept for your father?

882
01:46:3641,700-->01:46:3645,282
I have been living in a prison of fear
since that day.

883
01:46:3645,787-->01:46:3649,619
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

884
01:46:3650,542-->01:46:3653,708
To live in terror
every moment of every day

885
01:46:3653,795-->01:46:3656,582
because your son is heir to the throne.

886
01:46:3658,466-->01:46:3659,925
I have wept.

887
01:47:3601,261-->01:47:3604,096
My son was innocent.

888
01:47:3604,931-->01:47:3606,971
So is mine.

889
01:47:3608,977-->01:47:3612,061
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

890
01:47:3613,523-->01:47:3616,477
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

891
01:47:3617,360-->01:47:3620,397
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

892
01:47:3620,488-->01:47:3623,940
Today I saw a slave become more powerful
than the emperor of Rome.

893
01:47:3624,034-->01:47:3625,825
The gods have spared me?

894
01:47:3625,910-->01:47:3629,362
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

895
01:47:3629,456-->01:47:3631,164
That is power.

896
01:47:3631,458-->01:47:3632,620
The mob is Rome.

897
01:47:3632,709-->01:47:3636,457
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

898
01:47:3636,671-->01:47:3638,213
Listen to me.

899
01:47:3638,757-->01:47:3641,674
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

900
01:47:3641,968-->01:47:3644,210
But while the people follow him

901
01:47:3644,304-->01:47:3647,305
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

902
01:47:3648,308-->01:47:3650,715
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

903
01:47:3650,810-->01:47:3654,429
There are some politicians
who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

904
01:47:3654,522-->01:47:3656,266
One man above all.

905
01:47:3657,359-->01:48:3600,443
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

906
01:48:3600,779-->01:48:3602,688
Do you not understand?

907
01:48:3602,947-->01:48:3607,194
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

908
01:48:3607,285-->01:48:3609,907
What possible difference can I make?

909
01:48:3610,205-->01:48:3612,447
This man wants what you want.

910
01:48:3612,540-->01:48:3614,782
Then have him kill Commodus!

911
01:48:3617,337-->01:48:3619,164
I knew a man once

912
01:48:3620,090-->01:48:3621,418
a noble man.

913
01:48:3622,342-->01:48:3625,259
A man of principle who loved my father

914
01:48:3626,262-->01:48:3628,302
and my father loved him.

915
01:48:3630,266-->01:48:3632,425
This man served Rome well.

916
01:48:3636,773-->01:48:3638,481
That man is gone.

917
01:48:3639,651-->01:48:3641,774
Your brother did his work well.

918
01:48:3641,861-->01:48:3643,521
Let me help you.

919
01:48:3649,452-->01:48:3652,537
Yes, you can help me.

920
01:48:3655,875-->01:48:3659,576
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

921
01:49:3603,258-->01:49:3606,010
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

922
01:49:3634,456-->01:49:3636,116
What's your name?

923
01:49:3639,127-->01:49:3640,538
Julian Crassus.

924
01:49:3646,217-->01:49:3647,415
Name?

925
01:49:3648,762-->01:49:3650,256
Marcus, sire.

926
01:49:3651,181-->01:49:3653,008
My father's name.

927
01:50:3600,398-->01:50:3605,107
They must have known of Maximus' escape
when they found the bodies of the four men.

928
01:50:3605,945-->01:50:3608,519
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

929
01:50:3609,574-->01:50:3612,741
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

930
01:50:3620,001-->01:50:3622,041
Load your arrows!

931
01:50:3628,969-->01:50:3630,878
Prepare to fire!

932
01:50:3651,866-->01:50:3655,152
Then perhaps it was you
who knew

933
01:50:3655,996-->01:50:3657,454
and never told me.

934
01:50:3657,956-->01:51:3600,198
I didn't know.
You didn't know?

935
01:51:3601,710-->01:51:3604,545
But a general
is always in control.

936
01:51:3605,922-->01:51:3609,587
Always in command, isn't he?

937
01:51:3611,136-->01:51:3612,594
Yes, Caesar.

938
01:51:3626,526-->01:51:3629,195
Then give the command. Say it.

939
01:51:3646,129-->01:51:3647,292
Fire.

940
01:52:3622,540-->01:52:3623,821
Maximus.

941
01:52:3624,584-->01:52:3627,704
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

942
01:52:3628,588-->01:52:3630,830
Yes.
In Germania?

943
01:52:3632,717-->01:52:3634,461
In many countries.

944
01:52:3636,054-->01:52:3637,382
General.

945
01:53:3626,479-->01:53:3628,353
You have a great name.

946
01:53:3629,899-->01:53:3632,900
He must kill your name before he kills you.

947
01:53:3641,870-->01:53:3643,198
Yes, at the far end.

948
01:53:3643,288-->01:53:3645,613
Senator Gaius.
Hello.

949
01:53:3645,707-->01:53:3647,664
Senator Gracchus.

950
01:53:3649,294-->01:53:3652,663
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures
of the vulgar crowd.

951
01:53:3652,756-->01:53:3655,922
I don't pretend to be a man of the people,
Senator

952
01:53:3656,009-->01:53:3658,547
but I do try to be a man for the people.

953
01:54:3614,736-->01:54:3619,232
Caesar!

954
01:54:3624,496-->01:54:3626,204
People of Rome!

955
01:54:3628,458-->01:54:3630,866
On the fourth day of Antioch

956
01:54:3631,503-->01:54:3635,880
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

957
01:54:3636,508-->01:54:3640,755
And in his majestic charity

958
01:54:3641,513-->01:54:3645,724
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

959
01:54:3646,309-->01:54:3649,725
with an historical final match.

960
01:54:3650,522-->01:54:3655,100
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement

961
01:54:3656,528-->01:54:3659,979
Caesar is pleased to bring you

962
01:55:3600,073-->01:55:3603,857
the only undefeated champion

963
01:55:3603,952-->01:55:3605,944
in Roman history:

964
01:55:3606,037-->01:55:3610,913
The legendary Tigris of Gaul!

965
01:55:3632,564-->01:55:3635,730
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

966
01:55:3635,817-->01:55:3638,486
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

967
01:55:3638,570-->01:55:3641,321
This is not it.

968
01:55:3641,406-->01:55:3644,241
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

969
01:55:3645,076-->01:55:3647,698
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

970
01:55:3648,371-->01:55:3650,447
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

971
01:55:3650,540-->01:55:3654,407
Representing the training lyceum
of Antonius Proximo

972
01:55:3654,502-->01:55:3658,167
Caesar is proud to give you

973
01:55:3658,256-->01:56:3602,088
Aelius Maximus!

974
01:56:3614,898-->01:56:3617,270
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

975
01:56:3617,359-->01:56:3621,273
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

976
01:56:3624,032-->01:56:3626,867
No, much sooner than that.

977
01:56:3628,787-->01:56:3630,578
It's been arranged.

978
01:56:3649,099-->01:56:3652,053
We who are about to die salute you.

979
01:56:3655,355-->01:56:3657,312
We're with you, Maximus!

980
01:57:3639,774-->01:57:3641,316
Fight on, finish it!

981
01:58:3609,804-->01:58:3611,464
Pull, pull!

982
01:58:3643,838-->01:58:3645,416
Loose! Loose!

983
01:59:3613,493-->01:59:3615,569
Gut him!
Kill!

984
01:59:3617,038-->01:59:3620,621
Kill!

985
02:00:7220,977-->02:00:7223,184
Maximus the Merciful!

986
02:00:7232,364-->02:00:7237,156
Maximus!

987
02:00:7244,459-->02:00:7247,294
Forward, arms at ready!

988
02:01:7217,951-->02:01:7220,442
What am I going to do
with you?

989
02:01:7221,454-->02:01:7224,954
You simply won't die.

990
02:01:7229,754-->02:01:7232,080
Are we so different, you and I?

991
02:01:7233,216-->02:01:7236,134
You take life when you have to, as I do.

992
02:01:7237,512-->02:01:7241,557
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

993
02:01:7241,725-->02:01:7243,468
Then take it now.

994
02:01:7256,489-->02:01:7258,529
They tell me your son

995
02:01:7259,326-->02:02:7203,240
squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.

996
02:02:7205,415-->02:02:7207,075
And your wife

997
02:02:7208,293-->02:02:7210,202
moaned like a whore

998
02:02:7211,338-->02:02:7215,881
when they ravaged her again and again

999
02:02:7217,260-->02:02:7218,635
and again.

1000
02:02:7223,892-->02:02:7227,640
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end

1001
02:02:7232,275-->02:02:7233,604
Highness.

1002
02:02:7250,919-->02:02:7252,746
Maximus!

1003
02:03:7201,137-->02:03:7202,513
General!

1004
02:03:7209,020-->02:03:7211,096
General!
Cicero!

1005
02:03:7218,822-->02:03:7221,110
Where are you camped?
Ostia.

1006
02:03:7227,580-->02:03:7230,534
We love you, Maximus!
Praise the victor!

1007
02:03:7230,625-->02:03:7233,163
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

1008
02:03:7233,253-->02:03:7235,578
Move along!
Find me!

1009
02:04:7200,947-->02:04:7202,904
Can they hear you?

1010
02:04:7206,494-->02:04:7209,994
Who?
Your family, in the afterlife.

1011
02:04:7212,459-->02:04:7215,080
Yes.
What do you say to them?

1012
02:04:7218,715-->02:04:7220,174
To my boy

1013
02:04:7222,010-->02:04:7224,548
I tell him I will see him again soon

1014
02:04:7224,638-->02:04:7228,256
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

1015
02:04:7229,517-->02:04:7231,012
To my wife

1016
02:04:7233,521-->02:04:7235,644
that is not your business.

1017
02:04:7243,406-->02:04:7246,277
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1018
02:04:7247,702-->02:04:7251,237
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1019
02:04:7252,582-->02:04:7256,829
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

1020
02:04:7257,962-->02:04:7259,706
He is defying you.

1021
02:04:7259,881-->02:05:7203,297
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1022
02:05:7203,426-->02:05:7207,044
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1023
02:05:7207,764-->02:05:7210,681
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1024
02:05:7212,143-->02:05:7213,935
Kill him.
No.

1025
02:05:7215,814-->02:05:7218,221
I will not make a martyr of him.

1026
02:05:7225,365-->02:05:7227,903
When I went to the Senate today

1027
02:05:7227,993-->02:05:7232,868
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1028
02:05:7234,290-->02:05:7236,449
And did you note what happened?

1029
02:05:7236,543-->02:05:7239,746
Nothing.
Exactly. Nothing.

1030
02:05:7240,755-->02:05:7243,127
Not a single word of protest.

1031
02:05:7243,216-->02:05:7246,799
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.

1032
02:05:7246,886-->02:05:7248,049
Why?

1033
02:05:7249,806-->02:05:7253,471
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1034
02:05:7253,560-->02:05:7257,889
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1035
02:05:7258,064-->02:06:7201,813
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean
as if wounded.

1036
02:06:7202,235-->02:06:7205,070
Then its enemies will approach

1037
02:06:7205,155-->02:06:7208,239
and yet it will lie quite still.

1038
02:06:7208,575-->02:06:7212,407
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it

1039
02:06:7212,495-->02:06:7215,745
and yet it remains still.

1040
02:06:7219,002-->02:06:7220,164
So

1041
02:06:7221,504-->02:06:7223,248
we will lie still

1042
02:06:7224,090-->02:06:7227,424
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1043
02:06:7228,470-->02:06:7230,711
Have every senator followed.

1044
02:06:7248,406-->02:06:7252,190
Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps
I'd seen you for the last time.

1045
02:06:7252,285-->02:06:7254,693
I thought you were dead.
Close.

1046
02:06:7254,788-->02:06:7257,907
How long have the men been in Ostia?
All winter.

1047
02:06:7258,208-->02:07:7201,458
And how do they look?
Fat and bored.

1048
02:07:7202,170-->02:07:7205,337
Who's in command?
Some fool from Rome.

1049
02:07:7206,633-->02:07:7208,875
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

1050
02:07:7208,969-->02:07:7210,760
For you, tomorrow.

1051
02:07:7212,013-->02:07:7214,504
I need you to do something for me.

1052
02:07:7219,145-->02:07:7220,556
Come, see, witness.

1053
02:07:7220,647-->02:07:7223,683
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1054
02:07:7223,775-->02:07:7227,393
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1055
02:07:7227,487-->02:07:7230,060
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone

1056
02:07:7230,156-->02:07:7232,196
by doing this to him, they do

1057
02:07:7233,118-->02:07:7234,446
My goodness!

1058
02:07:7236,246-->02:07:7239,829
He got him, he's defeated.
Give way!

1059
02:07:7245,964-->02:07:7248,633
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

1060
02:07:7248,717-->02:07:7250,127
Back.
My lady.

1061
02:07:7250,218-->02:07:7252,376
I served your father at Vindobona.

1062
02:07:7252,721-->02:07:7253,800
Back!

1063
02:07:7253,888-->02:07:7257,092
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

1064
02:07:7258,601-->02:07:7259,764
Stop.

1065
02:08:7202,814-->02:08:7204,225
Stand back.

1066
02:08:7205,525-->02:08:7208,561
The General sends word,
he will meet your politician.

1067
02:08:7210,280-->02:08:7213,530
For your loyalty, soldier.
Thank you, my lady.

1068
02:08:7223,335-->02:08:7224,793
Leave us.

1069
02:08:7230,383-->02:08:7232,091
Senator Gracchus.

1070
02:08:7245,899-->02:08:7247,179
General.

1071
02:08:7248,276-->02:08:7250,981
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough

1072
02:08:7251,071-->02:08:7254,190
that you can trust me.

1073
02:08:7258,536-->02:09:7200,992
The Senate is with you?
The Senate?

1074
02:09:7202,499-->02:09:7205,203
Yes. I can speak for them.

1075
02:09:7205,794-->02:09:7209,163
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1076
02:09:7209,506-->02:09:7211,130
To what end?

1077
02:09:7212,425-->02:09:7214,751
Get me outside the city walls.

1078
02:09:7215,345-->02:09:7219,259
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia.
My army is encamped there.

1079
02:09:7219,349-->02:09:7222,682
By nightfall of the second day,
I'll return at the head of 5,000 men.

1080
02:09:7222,769-->02:09:7224,975
But the legions
all have new commanders

1081
02:09:7225,063-->02:09:7226,474
loyal to Commodus.

1082
02:09:7226,564-->02:09:7229,815
Let my men see me alive,
and you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1083
02:09:7229,901-->02:09:7231,561
This is madness.

1084
02:09:7232,153-->02:09:7235,487
No Roman army has entered the capital
in 100 years.

1085
02:09:7235,573-->02:09:7237,815
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

1086
02:09:7237,909-->02:09:7241,444
The time for half measures and talk is over,
Senator.

1087
02:09:7241,955-->02:09:7245,075
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1088
02:09:7246,292-->02:09:7249,958
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?

1089
02:09:7250,046-->02:09:7251,540
I will leave.

1090
02:09:7252,048-->02:09:7255,880
The soldiers will stay for your protection
under the command of the Senate.

1091
02:09:7255,969-->02:09:7257,131
So

1092
02:09:7257,470-->02:10:7201,717
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

1093
02:10:7203,268-->02:10:7204,727
Tell me why.

1094
02:10:7210,233-->02:10:7213,353
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

1095
02:10:7216,406-->02:10:7218,280
I will kill Commodus.

1096
02:10:7220,243-->02:10:7223,279
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1097
02:10:7225,165-->02:10:7227,407
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1098
02:10:7229,169-->02:10:7231,208
His daughter trusts you.

1099
02:10:7235,216-->02:10:7236,924
I will trust you.

1100
02:10:7237,302-->02:10:7239,341
But we have little time.

1101
02:10:7239,888-->02:10:7241,631
Give me two days

1102
02:10:7242,432-->02:10:7244,674
and I will buy your freedom.

1103
02:10:7245,393-->02:10:7246,971
And you

1104
02:10:7248,271-->02:10:7249,896
You stay alive

1105
02:10:7251,399-->02:10:7253,059
or I'll be dead.

1106
02:10:7254,903-->02:10:7256,480
Now we must go.

1107
02:11:7223,556-->02:11:7227,139
He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1108
02:11:7227,227-->02:11:7228,804
He'll find you.

1109
02:12:7212,939-->02:12:7214,433
It won't work.

1110
02:12:7215,483-->02:12:7217,642
The Emperor knows too much.

1111
02:12:7218,653-->02:12:7219,602
And as for me

1112
02:12:7221,614-->02:12:7223,691
it's becoming dangerous.

1113
02:12:7224,951-->02:12:7227,193
You'll be paid on my return.

1114
02:12:7229,289-->02:12:7231,080
I give you my word.

1115
02:12:7231,249-->02:12:7234,333
Your word? What if you don't return?

1116
02:12:7235,670-->02:12:7238,671
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1117
02:12:7238,757-->02:12:7239,955
Trust?

1118
02:12:7244,220-->02:12:7245,964
Who am I to trust?

1119
02:12:7246,556-->02:12:7250,091
I will kill Commodus.
Why would I want that?

1120
02:12:7250,518-->02:12:7252,226
He makes me rich.

1121
02:12:7257,359-->02:13:7200,194
I know that you are a man of your word,
General.

1122
02:13:7201,946-->02:13:7204,568
I know that you would die
for honor.

1123
02:13:7205,867-->02:13:7207,824
You would die for Rome.

1124
02:13:7208,870-->02:13:7212,037
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1125
02:13:7212,123-->02:13:7214,449
But I, on the other hand

1126
02:13:7217,128-->02:13:7218,920
I'm an entertainer.

1127
02:13:7222,425-->02:13:7223,623
Guard!

1128
02:13:7228,473-->02:13:7231,046
He killed the man who set you free.

1129
02:13:7240,235-->02:13:7242,062
Praetorians, master.

1130
02:13:7248,243-->02:13:7249,488
Halt!

1131
02:14:7254,559-->02:14:7256,552
Where have you been?

1132
02:14:7256,811-->02:14:7258,555
I sent for you.

1133
02:14:7259,981-->02:15:7201,641
Please, brother.

1134
02:15:7207,405-->02:15:7209,279
What's troubling you?

1135
02:15:7211,701-->02:15:7214,073
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1136
02:15:7215,872-->02:15:7217,497
I don't know.

1137
02:15:7219,376-->02:15:7221,452
I thought you'd seen him.

1138
02:15:7222,337-->02:15:7225,207
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

1139
02:15:7226,675-->02:15:7229,878
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1140
02:15:7230,303-->02:15:7232,296
And he will bleed, too.

1141
02:15:7233,223-->02:15:7234,598
Very soon.

1142
02:15:7236,101-->02:15:7237,761
But not tonight.

1143
02:15:7252,784-->02:15:7255,820
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1144
02:15:7257,080-->02:15:7258,740
"It's a dream

1145
02:16:7200,625-->02:16:7202,499
"a frightful dream

1146
02:16:7205,046-->02:16:7206,422
"life is."

1147
02:16:7209,092-->02:16:7211,168
Do you think that's true?

1148
02:16:7211,928-->02:16:7213,422
I don't know.

1149
02:16:7217,058-->02:16:7218,552
I think it is.

1150
02:16:7221,313-->02:16:7224,017
And I have only you to share it with.

1151
02:17:7201,645-->02:17:7203,222
Open your mouth.

1152
02:17:7240,558-->02:17:7242,385
You know I love you.

1153
02:17:7244,437-->02:17:7246,015
And I love you.

1154
02:18:7222,684-->02:18:7224,308
Out. Get out!

1155
02:18:7225,437-->02:18:7226,635
Move!

1156
02:18:7231,401-->02:18:7233,477
Congratulations, General.

1157
02:18:7233,570-->02:18:7236,405
You've got very persuasive friends.

1158
02:18:7242,287-->02:18:7244,778
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1159
02:18:7244,873-->02:18:7248,206
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1160
02:18:7248,418-->02:18:7252,036
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1161
02:18:7252,714-->02:18:7256,379
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there
with horses.

1162
02:18:7258,386-->02:19:7201,091
You have done all this?
Yes.

1163
02:19:7201,890-->02:19:7203,598
You risk too much.

1164
02:19:7204,559-->02:19:7206,552
I have much to pay for.

1165
02:19:7208,980-->02:19:7211,187
You have nothing to pay for.

1166
02:19:7211,274-->02:19:7214,358
You love your son. You're strong for him.

1167
02:19:7217,530-->02:19:7219,938
I am tired of being strong.

1168
02:19:7221,993-->02:19:7226,205
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

1169
02:19:7226,581-->02:19:7229,701
Because your father chose me.
No.

1170
02:19:7231,002-->02:19:7233,291
Because my father loved you.

1171
02:19:7237,175-->02:19:7239,583
And because I loved you.

1172
02:19:7242,180-->02:19:7243,840
A long time ago.

1173
02:19:7248,603-->02:19:7250,726
Was I very different then?

1174
02:19:7257,320-->02:19:7259,112
You laughed more.

1175
02:20:7203,118-->02:20:7205,525
I have felt alone all my life

1176
02:20:7206,830-->02:20:7208,490
except with you.

1177
02:20:7211,584-->02:20:7213,079
I must go.

1178
02:20:7213,628-->02:20:7214,743
Yes.

1179
02:20:7243,241-->02:20:7244,439
There.

1180
02:20:7256,004-->02:20:7257,546
And I got you.

1181
02:21:7200,550-->02:21:7202,756
Isn't it late
to be playing legionnaire?

1182
02:21:7202,844-->02:21:7204,718
I'm not a legionnaire.

1183
02:21:7204,971-->02:21:7207,593
Not a legionnaire?
I'm a gladiator.

1184
02:21:7208,850-->02:21:7210,309
A gladiator?

1185
02:21:7211,019-->02:21:7213,592
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1186
02:21:7213,772-->02:21:7217,188
Wouldn't you rather be
a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1187
02:21:7217,275-->02:21:7219,849
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1188
02:21:7222,697-->02:21:7224,524
The savior of Rome?

1189
02:21:7232,540-->02:21:7234,284
And who said that?

1190
02:21:7243,093-->02:21:7244,670
Where's Lucius?

1191
02:21:7245,929-->02:21:7248,301
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1192
02:21:7251,184-->02:21:7252,927
She couldn't.
She did.

1193
02:21:7253,019-->02:21:7255,178
She took it from a basket

1194
02:21:7256,481-->02:22:7200,265
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1195
02:22:7202,070-->02:22:7205,320
It bit her in the breast?
Yes.

1196
02:22:7206,032-->02:22:7209,982
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies

1197
02:22:7210,370-->02:22:7214,450
behave very strangely
and do very odd things in the name of love.

1198
02:22:7214,541-->02:22:7217,246
I think it's silly.
So do I.

1199
02:22:7221,006-->02:22:7223,045
Sister, join us.

1200
02:22:7223,675-->02:22:7225,418
I've been reading
to dear Lucius.

1201
02:22:7225,510-->02:22:7227,550
I've been reading, too.
Yes.

1202
02:22:7227,637-->02:22:7231,884
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1203
02:22:7233,518-->02:22:7237,302
We've been reading about the great
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1204
02:22:7237,397-->02:22:7239,935
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

1205
02:22:7240,025-->02:22:7243,643
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1206
02:22:7243,737-->02:22:7248,233
If you're very good, tomorrow night
I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1207
02:22:7249,492-->02:22:7251,236
He was betrayed

1208
02:22:7252,162-->02:22:7254,285
by those closest to him.

1209
02:22:7256,166-->02:22:7257,909
By his own blood.

1210
02:22:7259,252-->02:23:7201,743
They whispered in dark corners

1211
02:23:7201,838-->02:23:7204,127
and went out late at night

1212
02:23:7204,382-->02:23:7207,716
and conspired, and conspired.

1213
02:23:7210,263-->02:23:7214,177
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1214
02:23:7214,267-->02:23:7216,841
He knew they were busy little bees.

1215
02:23:7218,772-->02:23:7221,856
And one night he sat down
with one of them

1216
02:23:7222,609-->02:23:7224,601
and he looked at her

1217
02:23:7225,528-->02:23:7227,071
and he said:

1218
02:23:7228,156-->02:23:7230,694
"Tell me what you've been doing

1219
02:23:7231,368-->02:23:7233,111
"busy little bee.

1220
02:23:7235,413-->02:23:7238,533
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1221
02:23:7239,668-->02:23:7242,752
"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."

1222
02:23:7246,341-->02:23:7248,748
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1223
02:23:7250,887-->02:23:7255,763
The little bee had wounded him more deeply
than anyone else could ever have done.

1224
02:23:7257,978-->02:24:7200,848
What do you think happened then, Lucius?

1225
02:24:7201,481-->02:24:7203,308
I don't know, Uncle.

1226
02:24:7209,823-->02:24:7212,396
The little bee told him everything.

1227
02:25:7210,467-->02:25:7213,551
Open,
in the name of the Emperor!

1228
02:25:7214,137-->02:25:7215,417
Proximo!

1229
02:25:7216,306-->02:25:7219,509
Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!

1230
02:25:7223,813-->02:25:7225,272
Open the gates!

1231
02:25:7231,112-->02:25:7233,401
Open the gates, Proximo.

1232
02:25:7233,865-->02:25:7236,107
Do you want to die, old man?

1233
02:25:7237,327-->02:25:7238,442
Here.

1234
02:25:7239,079-->02:25:7241,155
Everything is prepared.

1235
02:25:7241,247-->02:25:7243,738
It seems you have won your freedom.

1236
02:25:7243,833-->02:25:7247,416
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1237
02:25:7252,509-->02:25:7256,341
Juba.
All enemies of the emperor die!

1238
02:25:7256,888-->02:25:7259,046
Open the gates!

1239
02:26:7204,562-->02:26:7206,520
Pull!

1240
02:26:7208,692-->02:26:7211,527
Move!
Form a column on the left!

1241
02:26:7215,323-->02:26:7218,360
I only need moments,
so do not be careless with your lives.

1242
02:26:7218,451-->02:26:7221,203
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1243
02:26:7221,287-->02:26:7223,446
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1244
02:26:7223,540-->02:26:7226,410
Strength and honor.
Go.

1245
02:26:7227,293-->02:26:7229,120
Strength and honor.

1246
02:26:7231,756-->02:26:7234,591
Aim. Arch your bows!

1247
02:27:7241,701-->02:27:7242,982
Shadows and dust.

1248
02:28:7224,911-->02:28:7226,026
Maximus!

1249
02:28:7231,626-->02:28:7233,037
I'm sorry.

1250
02:28:7259,446-->02:29:7200,821
It's done.

1251
02:29:7207,787-->02:29:7209,863
And what of my nephew?

1252
02:29:7210,749-->02:29:7212,741
And what of his mother?

1253
02:29:7214,794-->02:29:7217,368
Should they share her lover's fate?

1254
02:29:7219,090-->02:29:7221,130
Or should I be merciful?

1255
02:29:7223,845-->02:29:7225,754
Commodus the Merciful.

1256
02:29:7232,228-->02:29:7234,517
Lucius will stay with me now.

1257
02:29:7235,649-->02:29:7237,475
And if his mother

1258
02:29:7238,902-->02:29:7240,978
so much as looks at me

1259
02:29:7242,155-->02:29:7244,646
in a manner that displeases me

1260
02:29:7246,618-->02:29:7248,077
he will die.

1261
02:29:7251,498-->02:29:7254,783
If she decides to be noble

1262
02:29:7256,544-->02:29:7258,620
and takes her own life

1263
02:30:7200,215-->02:30:7201,674
he will die.

1264
02:30:7205,303-->02:30:7207,130
And as for you

1265
02:30:7209,849-->02:30:7211,641
you will love me

1266
02:30:7212,352-->02:30:7214,179
as I have loved you.

1267
02:30:7215,772-->02:30:7219,437
You will provide me
with an heir of pure blood

1268
02:30:7220,443-->02:30:7222,235
so that Commodus

1269
02:30:7222,821-->02:30:7225,775
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1270
02:30:7230,412-->02:30:7232,155
Am I not merciful?

1271
02:30:7254,019-->02:30:7256,640
Am I not merciful!

1272
02:31:7208,867-->02:31:7212,070
Maximus!

1273
02:31:7240,315-->02:31:7243,067
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1274
02:31:7245,779-->02:31:7250,073
Nothing happens to anyone
that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1275
02:32:7223,024-->02:32:7224,305
Maximus!

1276
02:32:7230,699-->02:32:7232,608
They call for you.

1277
02:32:7234,494-->02:32:7237,744
The general
who became a slave.

1278
02:32:7238,999-->02:32:7241,406
The slave who became a gladiator.

1279
02:32:7242,752-->02:32:7245,587
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1280
02:32:7247,507-->02:32:7249,215
A striking story.

1281
02:32:7250,385-->02:32:7253,670
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1282
02:32:7255,974-->02:32:7258,216
Only a famous death will do.

1283
02:33:7200,145-->02:33:7202,683
And what could be more glorious

1284
02:33:7203,064-->02:33:7206,813
than to challenge the Emperor himself
in the great arena?

1285
02:33:7209,154-->02:33:7212,190
You would fight me?
Why not?

1286
02:33:7213,408-->02:33:7215,447
Do you think I'm afraid?

1287
02:33:7216,244-->02:33:7219,245
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1288
02:33:7219,372-->02:33:7223,073
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1289
02:33:7228,840-->02:33:7231,876
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1290
02:33:7233,136-->02:33:7235,592
"All a man can do is smile back."

1291
02:33:7237,390-->02:33:7238,801
I wonder

1292
02:33:7239,434-->02:33:7242,221
did your friend smile at his own death?

1293
02:33:7242,604-->02:33:7244,146
You must know.

1294
02:33:7247,025-->02:33:7248,816
He was your father.

1295
02:33:7252,697-->02:33:7255,022
You loved my father, I know

1296
02:33:7256,534-->02:33:7258,029
but so did I.

1297
02:33:7259,663-->02:34:7202,236
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1298
02:34:7204,876-->02:34:7206,999
Smile for me now, brother.

1299
02:34:7212,509-->02:34:7215,296
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

1300
02:35:7209,733-->02:35:7211,690
Ring formation!

1301
02:37:7203,513-->02:37:7205,091
Quintus, sword.

1302
02:37:7206,599-->02:37:7208,391
Give me your sword.

1303
02:37:7211,813-->02:37:7213,806
Sword! Give me a sword!

1304
02:37:7215,317-->02:37:7217,143
Sheathe your swords.

1305
02:39:7234,331-->02:39:7235,741
Maximus.

1306
02:39:7242,881-->02:39:7244,209
Quintus.

1307
02:39:7245,884-->02:39:7247,343
Free my men.

1308
02:39:7248,803-->02:39:7251,508
Senator Gracchus
is to be reinstated.

1309
02:39:7252,724-->02:39:7254,800
There was a dream that was Rome.

1310
02:39:7255,477-->02:39:7257,350
It shall be realized.

1311
02:39:7258,104-->02:40:7200,678
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1312
02:40:7201,566-->02:40:7203,642
Free the prisoners. Go!

1313
02:40:7228,343-->02:40:7229,623
Maximus.

1314
02:40:7231,554-->02:40:7233,132
Lucius is safe.

1315
02:40:7249,447-->02:40:7250,858
Go to them.

1316
02:41:7240,665-->02:41:7242,124
You're home.

1317
02:42:7208,735-->02:42:7211,308
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1318
02:42:7215,158-->02:42:7216,985
We believed it once.

1319
02:42:7220,163-->02:42:7222,239
Make us believe it again.

1320
02:42:7225,794-->02:42:7227,870
He was a soldier of Rome.

1321
02:42:7231,716-->02:42:7233,127
Honor him.

1322
02:42:7233,593-->02:42:7235,752
Who will help me carry him?

1323
02:43:7220,515-->02:43:7222,175
Now we are free.

1324
02:43:7228,565-->02:43:7230,439
I will see you again.

1325
02:43:7233,320-->02:43:7234,778
But not yet.

1326
02:43:7235,780-->02:43:7237,109
Not yet.
