1
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:18,808
Sir.

2
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:20,391
General.

3
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:32,149
Sir.

4
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,758
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:54,718
Still nothing?
Not a sign.

6
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:58,343
How long has he been gone?
Nearly two hours.

7
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,480
Will they fight, sir?

8
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,024
We shall know soon enough.

9
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:06,778
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

10
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:09,187
They're out of range.
Range is good.

11
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,156
The danger to the cavalry
Is acceptable. Agreed?

12
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,082
They say no.

13
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,402
People should know
when they're conquered.

14
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:05,668
Would you, Quintus?

15
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:07,868
Would I?

16
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:27,311
Strength and honor.

17
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:36,067
At my signal, unleash hell.

18
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,349
Load the catapults.

19
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,183
Infantry form up for advance.

20
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:07,054
Archers ready.
Archers!

21
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:08,607
Nock!

22
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:33,799
Fratres!

23
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:35,841
Maximus!

24
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:41,008
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

25
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:45,810
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

26
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,855
Hold the line! Stay with me!

27
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:52,611
If you find yourself alone

28
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:55,695
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face

29
00:06:56,948 --> 00:06:59,071
do not be troubled.

30
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,575
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

31
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:07,367
Brothers

32
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:10,579
what we do in life

33
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,628
echoes in eternity.

34
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:23,087
Pull!

35
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:40,738
Catapults ready, sir!

36
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,786
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,502
Ignite!

38
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:05,183
Archers, draw!

39
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,015
Loose!

40
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,417
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,926
Hold the line!

42
00:08:57,193 --> 00:08:59,316
Loose!

43
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:00,863
Reload!

44
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,861
Hold the line!

45
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:10,326
Draw!
Loose!

46
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,667
Stay with me!

47
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:22,214
Stay with me!

48
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:53,075
Roma victor!

49
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,103
Roma victor!

50
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:12,943
Do you think he's really dying?

51
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,818
He's been dying for 10 years.

52
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:20,246
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

53
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,241
Maybe he just misses us.

54
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,003
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if

55
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,249
Peace, Commodus.

56
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,382
After two weeks on the road,
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

57
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:41,223
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

58
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:46,765
He will name me.

59
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:53,271
The first thing I shall do when

60
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:59,361
Is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

61
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:04,282
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

62
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:07,787
Your Highness?

63
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:14,082
We seem to be almost there, sire.

64
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:21,967
Sire.
Where's the Emperor?

65
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,227
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

66
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:28,014
The wounded are still coming in.

67
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:29,732
My horse.

68
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:31,478
My lord.

69
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:36,111
Kiss?

70
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:15,484
You have proved your valor yet again,
Maximus.

71
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:20,445
Let us hope, for the last time.

72
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:23,152
There's no one left to fight, sire.

73
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:25,737
There is always someone left to fight.

74
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:28,875
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

75
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,835
Let me go home.

76
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,668
Home.

77
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:00,026
They honor you, Caesar.

78
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:02,904
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

79
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:28,597
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

80
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,063
You have missed the war.

81
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,355
Father, congratulations.

82
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:37,225
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

83
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,980
Save the bulls.

84
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:41,528
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

85
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,275
General.
Highness.

86
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,905
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

87
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:50,790
It has been too long, my old friend.

88
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,251
Highness.

89
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,950
Here, Father. Take my arm.

90
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,751
I think it is time for me to leave.

91
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,233
So much for the glory of Rome.

92
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,075
Magnificent battle.

93
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,726
General. Still alive?

94
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:16,092
Still alive.

95
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:17,812
The gods must have a sense of humor.

96
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,567
The gods must love you.
Valerius.

97
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,437
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

98
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,690
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

99
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:30,657
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

100
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:34,326
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

101
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,537
Here he is.
Highness.

102
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,783
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

103
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,831
Beware of Gaius.
He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear

104
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:45,421
and you'll wake up one day and all
you'll say is, Republic."

105
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:48,178
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

106
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:50,883
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

107
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:53,463
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

108
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:56,180
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

109
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:01,097
A soldier has the advantage of being able
to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

110
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:05,439
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

111
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:08,613
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

112
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,911
Maximus.

113
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:23,500
I'm going to need good men like you.

114
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:28,170
How may I be of service, Highness?

115
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,881
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

116
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:34,673
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed,
and the battle is won.

117
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:39,558
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

118
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,059
We must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

119
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:46,234
Can I count on you when the time comes?

120
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:55,111
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

121
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:58,406
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

122
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,700
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

123
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:08,329
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

124
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:10,793
She's not forgotten you.

125
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:14,218
And now, you're the great man.

126
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:29,226
If only you had been born a man

127
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,563
what a Caesar you would have made.

128
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:35,701
Father.

129
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,534
You would have been strong.

130
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:46,830
I wonder, would you have been just?

131
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:50,419
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

132
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:53,928
How was your journey?

133
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:58,176
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

134
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,971
I need your help. With your brother.

135
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,097
Of course.

136
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,346
He loves you. He always has.

137
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,520
And

138
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:12,611
he will need you now, more than ever.

139
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:19,534
Enough of politics.

140
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,872
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter

141
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,663
and I am a good father.

142
00:22:31,258 --> 00:22:34,009
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

143
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,523
Good morning.

144
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,035
I need three more horses.

145
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:16,335
Two! Three!

146
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:18,257
Four!

147
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:21,016
One! Two!

148
00:23:36,823 --> 00:23:38,982
You sent for me, Caesar?

149
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,415
Caesar?
Tell me again, Maximus.

150
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,208
Why are we here?

151
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:53,041
For the glory of the empire, sire.

152
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:54,586
Yes.

153
00:23:56,593 --> 00:23:58,586
Yes, I remember.

154
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,881
Do you see that map, Maximus?

155
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:07,222
That is the world which I created.

156
00:24:08,104 --> 00:24:09,682
For 25 years

157
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:14,141
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

158
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:19,360
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

159
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:21,905
Four years of peace in 20.

160
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:23,696
And for what?

161
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:34,911
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

162
00:24:36,216 --> 00:24:37,496
Caesar, your life

163
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:40,166
Please. Please don't call me that.

164
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:42,717
Come. Please.

165
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:44,890
Come sit.

166
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:48,430
Let us talk together now

167
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:51,435
very simply, as men.

168
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,934
Well, Maximus

169
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,482
talk.

170
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:03,319
5,000 of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

171
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:07,034
3,000 of them are bloodied and cleaved.
2,000 will never leave this place.

172
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:10,158
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

173
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,874
And what would you believe?

174
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,792
They fought for you and for Rome.

175
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,672
And what is Rome, Maximus?

176
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:22,250
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

177
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:26,343
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

178
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,342
Yet you have never been there.

179
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:30,842
You have not seen what it has become.

180
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:34,015
I am dying, Maximus.

181
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:36,351
When a man sees his end

182
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:39,527
he wants to know there was some purpose
to his life.

183
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:43,316
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

184
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,738
Will I be known as the philosopher?

185
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,286
The warrior?

186
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:49,031
The tyrant?

187
00:25:50,457 --> 00:25:55,083
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

188
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,460
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

189
00:25:58,548 --> 00:26:01,383
You could only whisper it.

190
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:04,634
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish

191
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:06,464
it was so fragile.

192
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:10,507
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

193
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,479
Maximus

194
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:17,315
let us whisper now

195
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,311
together, you and I.

196
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:21,522
You have a son.

197
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:24,900
Tell me about your home.

198
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,993
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

199
00:26:35,418 --> 00:26:37,162
A very simple place.

200
00:26:37,587 --> 00:26:40,541
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

201
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:44,083
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day

202
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,754
jasmine in the evening.

203
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:51,005
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

204
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,144
Figs, apples, pears.

205
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:58,096
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

206
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:01,267
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

207
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:03,603
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

208
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:05,321
He wants to be one of them.

209
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:07,234
When was the last time you were home?

210
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,410
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

211
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:15,324
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

212
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:18,751
Worth fighting for.

213
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,713
There is one more duty

214
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:27,011
that I ask of you before you go home.

215
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,053
What would you have me do, Caesar?

216
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:34,759
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

217
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:38,938
I will empower you to one end alone

218
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:42,982
to give power back to the people of Rome

219
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,362
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

220
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:56,286
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

221
00:27:57,751 --> 00:27:59,660
With all my heart, no.

222
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,874
Maximus

223
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:07,383
that is why it must be you.

224
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,545
But surely a prefect, a senator

225
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:12,211
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

226
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:15,510
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

227
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,058
And Commodus?
Commodus is not a moral man.

228
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:27,483
You have known that since you were young.

229
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:29,654
Commodus cannot rule.

230
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,113
He must not rule.

231
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:36,449
You are the son that I should have had.

232
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,001
Commodus will accept my decision.

233
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:48,964
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

234
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,510
I need some time, sire.

235
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,059
Yes.

236
00:28:57,143 --> 00:29:00,726
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

237
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,931
Now embrace me as my son.

238
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:10,067
And bring an old man another blanket.

239
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:29,293
My father favors you now.
My lady.

240
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,420
It was not always so.
Many things change.

241
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,846
Many things. Not everything.

242
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,428
Maximus, stop.

243
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,891
Let me see your face.

244
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,404
You seem upset.
I lost many men.

245
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:54,399
What did my father want with you?

246
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,447
To wish me well before I leave for home.

247
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:00,616
You're lying.

248
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:04,290
I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.

249
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:06,915
I never acquired your comfort with it.
True.

250
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,128
But then you never had to.

251
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:12,337
Life is more simple for a soldier.

252
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:16,343
Or do you think me heartless?

253
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,100
I think you have a talent for survival.

254
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:27,650
Maximus, stop.

255
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:32,477
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

256
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:35,313
No. I'm tired from battle.

257
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:38,868
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

258
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,953
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

259
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:50,878
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

260
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:55,168
I will always serve Rome.

261
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:58,924
Do you know

262
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:01,506
I still remember you in my prayers.

263
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,431
Oh, yes. I pray.

264
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:13,312
I was sad to hear of your husband's death.
I mourned him.

265
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:18,033
Thank you.
And I hear you have a son.

266
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:22,110
Yes. Lucius.

267
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,699
He'll be nearly eight years old.

268
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:28,034
My son is also nearly eight.

269
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:33,211
I thank you for your prayers.

270
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,387
Ancestors,
I ask for your guidance.

271
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:48,221
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

272
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:53,600
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son
with a ready sword.

273
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:58,107
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

274
00:31:58,825 --> 00:32:00,984
Ancestors, I honor you

275
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:05,489
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

276
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:29,772
Cicero.

277
00:32:34,194 --> 00:32:35,308
Sir.

278
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:42,321
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

279
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,653
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

280
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,162
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

281
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:56,839
We may not be able to go home, after all.

282
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:50,721
Are you ready to do your duty
for Rome?

283
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,274
Yes, Father.

284
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,477
You will not be emperor.

285
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:04,154
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

286
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,780
My powers will pass to Maximus

287
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:09,739
to hold in trust

288
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,580
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

289
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:18,579
Rome is to be a republic again.

290
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:23,082
Maximus.
Yes.

291
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:31,432
My decision disappoints you?

292
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:37,021
You wrote to me once

293
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:41,309
listing the four chief virtues:

294
00:34:43,073 --> 00:34:44,353
Wisdom

295
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:45,908
justice

296
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,576
fortitude

297
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:49,744
and temperance.

298
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:55,035
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.

299
00:34:56,002 --> 00:34:58,458
But I have other virtues, Father.

300
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:01,001
Ambition.

301
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:05,218
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

302
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:09,639
Resourcefulness, courage.

303
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:15,019
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

304
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,898
Devotion to my family

305
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:22,403
to you.

306
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:26,692
But none of my virtues were on your list.

307
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:32,119
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

308
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:33,700
Commodus

309
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:36,284
you go too far.

310
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:40,086
I searched the faces of the gods

311
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:45,216
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

312
00:35:46,094 --> 00:35:48,087
One kind word

313
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,387
one full hug

314
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:54,264
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight

315
00:35:55,395 --> 00:35:58,930
would have been like the sun on my heart
for 1,000 years.

316
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,231
What is it in me you hate
so much?

317
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:05,483
Commodus.

318
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:08,696
All I've ever wanted

319
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,197
was to live up to you, Caesar.

320
00:36:14,497 --> 00:36:17,071
Father.
Commodus

321
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,669
your faults as a son

322
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:27,918
is my failure as a father.

323
00:36:38,688 --> 00:36:40,147
Come.

324
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,194
Father.

325
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,790
I would butcher the whole world

326
00:37:03,713 --> 00:37:06,169
if you would only have loved me!

327
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,754
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

328
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:54,214
Lament with me, brother.

329
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:57,264
Our great father is dead.

330
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,710
How did he die?

331
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,549
The surgeons say
there was no pain.

332
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,750
His breath gave out as he slept.

333
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,895
Father.

334
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,061
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

335
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:51,069
Take my hand.

336
00:38:53,782 --> 00:38:55,609
I only offer it once.

337
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:11,209
Quintus.

338
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:02,891
Hail, Caesar.

339
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,431
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

340
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:09,095
Wake Gaius and Falco.
Gaius and Falco.

341
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,432
Sword.

342
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,816
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

343
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:19,943
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

344
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,781
The Emperor died
of natural causes.

345
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:26,656
Why are you armed, Quintus?
Guards!

346
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:32,078
Please don't fight, Maximus.

347
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,087
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

348
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:38,378
Ride until dawn

349
00:40:39,596 --> 00:40:41,138
and then execute him.

350
00:40:41,223 --> 00:40:43,630
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

351
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:46,804
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

352
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:50,607
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

353
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:16,663
Kneel.

354
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:22,587
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.

355
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:25,765
Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.

356
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,762
At least give me a clean death.

357
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:34,273
A soldier's death.

358
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,797
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

359
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,815
Praetorian!

360
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,478
When was the last time
you were home?

361
00:43:42,571 --> 00:43:45,607
Two years,
264 days and this morning.

362
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:49,074
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son

363
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,486
I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

364
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,987
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

365
00:43:54,082 --> 00:43:56,655
with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.

366
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:59,752
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

367
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,127
For all else is dust and air.

368
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,393
Papa!

369
00:47:48,483 --> 00:47:49,977
Don't die.

370
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:58,400
You'll meet them again.

371
00:48:00,036 --> 00:48:01,317
Not yet.

372
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:13,670
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

373
00:48:48,043 --> 00:48:49,418
Don't die.

374
00:48:50,212 --> 00:48:52,584
They'll feed you to the lions.

375
00:48:52,714 --> 00:48:54,956
They are worth more than we are.

376
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:06,435
Better now?

377
00:49:07,562 --> 00:49:09,471
Clean. You see?

378
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:43,013
Proximo! My old friend.

379
00:49:44,432 --> 00:49:47,469
Every day is a great day when you are here

380
00:49:47,936 --> 00:49:52,099
but today is your most fortunate day.

381
00:49:54,776 --> 00:49:58,477
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

382
00:49:59,114 --> 00:50:02,981
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

383
00:50:04,286 --> 00:50:07,203
You sold me queer giraffes.

384
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:10,792
I want my money back.
Not a chance.

385
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:17,748
I do special price for you.
On what?

386
00:50:19,301 --> 00:50:22,218
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

387
00:50:36,151 --> 00:50:38,986
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

388
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,692
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

389
00:50:41,907 --> 00:50:44,232
You need both, I think.

390
00:50:44,326 --> 00:50:45,524
Get up.

391
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:55,370
What's your trade?

392
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:57,166
I was a hunter.

393
00:50:57,255 --> 00:51:00,920
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

394
00:51:01,718 --> 00:51:03,093
Sit down.

395
00:51:06,973 --> 00:51:08,218
Mark of the legion.

396
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:12,637
Deserter.
Maybe so, but who cares?

397
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:13,844
He's a Spaniard.

398
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:15,848
I'll take six. For 1,000.

399
00:51:15,941 --> 00:51:19,523
One thousand?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

400
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:21,604
These slaves are rotten.

401
00:51:21,696 --> 00:51:24,863
It all adds to the flavor. No, wait!

402
00:51:25,408 --> 00:51:27,116
I can negotiate.

403
00:51:28,203 --> 00:51:32,283
I'll give you 2,000, and 4,000 for the beasts.

404
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:34,616
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

405
00:51:52,227 --> 00:51:55,430
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

406
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,640
I am Proximo.

407
00:51:58,233 --> 00:52:00,902
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days

408
00:52:00,986 --> 00:52:03,227
which will be the last
of your miserable lives

409
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:07,319
than that bitch of a mother
that brought you screaming into this world.

410
00:52:07,951 --> 00:52:11,284
I did not pay good money for you
for your company.

411
00:52:12,455 --> 00:52:15,659
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

412
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:20,166
And as your mother was there
at your beginning

413
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:23,794
so I shall be there at your end.

414
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:28,297
And when you die, and die you shall

415
00:52:29,264 --> 00:52:32,181
your transition shall be to the sound of

416
00:52:36,855 --> 00:52:38,314
Gladiators

417
00:52:39,482 --> 00:52:40,977
I salute you.

418
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,025
Red.

419
00:52:50,452 --> 00:52:51,780
Yellow.

420
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:54,199
Yellow.

421
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:06,164
Good.

422
00:53:06,843 --> 00:53:08,006
Red.

423
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:14,470
Spaniard.

424
00:53:47,842 --> 00:53:50,168
That's enough for the moment!

425
00:53:50,512 --> 00:53:52,089
His time will come.

426
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,179
Next.

427
00:54:09,573 --> 00:54:10,853
Spaniard

428
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:14,194
why don't you fight?

429
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:16,030
We all have to fight.

430
00:54:16,121 --> 00:54:18,030
Well, I don't fight.

431
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:21,707
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words

432
00:54:21,793 --> 00:54:23,702
and speak seven languages.

433
00:54:23,795 --> 00:54:24,993
Good.

434
00:54:25,714 --> 00:54:28,750
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

435
00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:40,641
Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.

436
00:54:41,396 --> 00:54:42,641
Freedom?

437
00:54:43,773 --> 00:54:45,565
What do I have to do?

438
00:54:45,984 --> 00:54:48,273
You go in the arena and you kill me.

439
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:49,778
And him

440
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:52,281
and the Numidian

441
00:54:52,574 --> 00:54:54,116
and the deserter.

442
00:54:55,744 --> 00:54:57,238
And 100 more.

443
00:54:57,329 --> 00:55:00,080
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

444
00:55:00,749 --> 00:55:02,492
I can't do that.

445
00:55:03,585 --> 00:55:04,748
No?

446
00:55:11,009 --> 00:55:12,420
But I can.

447
00:55:27,943 --> 00:55:30,149
Is that the sign of your gods?

448
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:37,443
Will that not anger them?

449
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:00,467
The gods favor you.

450
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:02,967
Red is the gods' color.

451
00:56:04,354 --> 00:56:06,560
You will need their help today.

452
00:56:45,896 --> 00:56:47,520
Proximo!

453
00:56:52,861 --> 00:56:55,019
Still leading with the German?

454
00:56:55,113 --> 00:56:57,236
The crowd love a barbarian.

455
00:56:57,699 --> 00:56:59,608
Besides that, he's making me rich.

456
00:56:59,701 --> 00:57:02,274
Has that Numidian fought before?

457
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:04,699
No, first time.

458
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:07,743
And that one, laborer, soldier?

459
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:12,539
He's a Spaniard. He might as well
be a eunuch, for what he brings to the ring.

460
00:57:13,548 --> 00:57:17,760
Five hundred sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

461
00:57:17,886 --> 00:57:21,551
And 1,000,
that the Numidian makes it through alone.

462
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:26,219
Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?

463
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,391
It's unethical.

464
00:57:29,606 --> 00:57:31,480
What if I make it 2,000?

465
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,831
Some of you are thinking you won't fight

466
00:57:50,126 --> 00:57:52,119
some that you can't fight.

467
00:57:52,921 --> 00:57:56,420
They all say that until they're out there.

468
00:57:59,094 --> 00:58:00,292
Listen.

469
00:58:01,096 --> 00:58:03,765
Kill!

470
00:58:10,355 --> 00:58:13,107
Thrust this into another man's flesh

471
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:16,152
and they will applaud and love you for that.

472
00:58:16,278 --> 00:58:17,653
And you

473
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:21,613
you may begin to love them

474
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,826
for that.

475
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:31,539
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

476
00:58:34,004 --> 00:58:36,292
Sadly, we cannot choose how

477
00:58:37,424 --> 00:58:40,175
but we can decide how we meet that end

478
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:43,710
in order that we are remembered

479
00:58:45,682 --> 00:58:46,845
as men.

480
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:48,012
Come on!

481
00:58:51,021 --> 00:58:53,393
On the left, draw your shields!

482
00:58:54,357 --> 00:58:56,729
On the right, draw your swords!

483
00:58:57,402 --> 00:58:59,478
Kill! Kill!

484
00:59:00,697 --> 00:59:03,069
Pair them up: Red with yellow.

485
00:59:08,163 --> 00:59:09,325
Next!

486
00:59:15,212 --> 00:59:16,410
Move!

487
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,608
Usurper!

488
01:02:57,392 --> 01:03:00,512
Go away!
You'll never rule us, Commodus!

489
01:03:30,467 --> 01:03:35,176
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?

490
01:03:35,472 --> 01:03:37,761
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

491
01:03:37,974 --> 01:03:40,133
I think he could do very well.

492
01:03:40,644 --> 01:03:42,683
For Rome, or for you?

493
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,194
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

494
01:03:58,453 --> 01:04:00,446
Lucius!
Mother!

495
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:04,160
Hail, Caesar.

496
01:04:04,376 --> 01:04:05,870
Senators.

497
01:04:09,548 --> 01:04:12,465
Rome greets her new emperor.

498
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:16,050
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

499
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:18,006
Thank you, Falco.

500
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:22,184
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

501
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:24,308
Caesar.
Gracchus.

502
01:04:24,396 --> 01:04:26,851
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

503
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,143
There are many matters
that require your attention.

504
01:04:32,904 --> 01:04:35,739
To order, please. To order.

505
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:40,867
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols

506
01:04:40,996 --> 01:04:44,032
to begin addressing the many problems
in the city

507
01:04:44,165 --> 01:04:48,210
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter

508
01:04:48,753 --> 01:04:52,039
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

509
01:04:52,424 --> 01:04:54,215
So, if Caesar

510
01:04:56,386 --> 01:04:58,260
Don't you see, Gracchus?

511
01:04:59,681 --> 01:05:02,006
That's the very problem, isn't it?

512
01:05:02,392 --> 01:05:05,310
My father spent all his time
at study

513
01:05:06,855 --> 01:05:10,224
at books of learning and philosophy.

514
01:05:11,234 --> 01:05:15,184
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

515
01:05:15,697 --> 01:05:18,864
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

516
01:05:19,534 --> 01:05:21,693
But the Senate is the people, sire

517
01:05:21,786 --> 01:05:25,286
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

518
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:29,534
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

519
01:05:30,378 --> 01:05:32,869
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

520
01:05:32,964 --> 01:05:35,087
I think I understand my own people.

521
01:05:35,175 --> 01:05:38,626
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us

522
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:41,592
out of his own extensive experience.

523
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,102
I call it love.

524
01:05:47,604 --> 01:05:50,771
I am their father.
The people are my children.

525
01:05:51,066 --> 01:05:53,687
I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

526
01:05:53,777 --> 01:05:56,813
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

527
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:05,985
No, but if you interrupt me again

528
01:06:07,499 --> 01:06:08,874
I assure you that you shall.

529
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:11,284
Senator, my brother is very tired.

530
01:06:12,295 --> 01:06:16,459
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

531
01:06:17,008 --> 01:06:21,966
My lady, as always,
your lightest touch commands obedience.

532
01:06:29,104 --> 01:06:31,429
Who are they to lecture me?

533
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:34,139
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

534
01:06:34,276 --> 01:06:37,146
What uses? All they do is talk.

535
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:42,948
It should be just you and me and Rome.

536
01:06:43,034 --> 01:06:46,320
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

537
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:48,490
Rome has changed.

538
01:06:48,582 --> 01:06:51,618
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

539
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,834
Of course, but leave the people their

540
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,462
Illusions?

541
01:06:57,048 --> 01:06:58,507
Traditions.

542
01:06:59,342 --> 01:07:02,177
My father's war against the barbarians

543
01:07:02,721 --> 01:07:06,386
He said it himself: It achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

544
01:07:06,474 --> 01:07:08,384
The people always love victories.

545
01:07:08,476 --> 01:07:12,142
Why? They didn't see the battles.

546
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:15,474
What do they care about Germania?

547
01:07:15,567 --> 01:07:17,856
They care about the greatness of Rome.

548
01:07:17,944 --> 01:07:19,853
"The greatness of Rome."

549
01:07:21,823 --> 01:07:23,567
Well, what is that?

550
01:07:26,328 --> 01:07:29,531
It's an idea. Greatness.

551
01:07:33,335 --> 01:07:36,786
Greatness is a vision.
Exactly. A vision.

552
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,714
Do you not see, Lucilla?

553
01:07:42,093 --> 01:07:46,043
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they'll love me for it.

554
01:07:46,723 --> 01:07:51,100
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

555
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,864
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

556
01:08:57,085 --> 01:09:00,205
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

557
01:09:08,263 --> 01:09:09,426
Games.

558
01:09:11,766 --> 01:09:14,803
One hundred and fifty days of games.

559
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:16,930
He's cleverer than I thought.

560
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:20,521
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him

561
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:23,518
if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.

562
01:09:23,612 --> 01:09:26,447
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

563
01:09:27,824 --> 01:09:30,944
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

564
01:09:31,036 --> 01:09:34,120
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

565
01:09:34,831 --> 01:09:37,951
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

566
01:09:38,543 --> 01:09:41,793
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

567
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:46,793
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

568
01:09:46,885 --> 01:09:48,877
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

569
01:09:50,805 --> 01:09:52,845
He'll bring them death

570
01:09:54,643 --> 01:09:56,968
and they will love him for it.

571
01:10:19,709 --> 01:10:21,749
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

572
01:10:21,836 --> 01:10:24,244
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

573
01:10:24,339 --> 01:10:26,415
We want them to keep coming back.

574
01:10:26,508 --> 01:10:30,671
So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

575
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:34,593
Spaniard.

576
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,935
So entertain!

577
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:53,171
Are you not entertained?

578
01:11:55,513 --> 01:11:57,755
Is this not why you're here?

579
01:12:02,354 --> 01:12:04,761
Spaniard!

580
01:12:22,624 --> 01:12:24,367
What do you want?

581
01:12:26,962 --> 01:12:28,124
Girl?

582
01:12:29,172 --> 01:12:30,287
Boy?

583
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:33,458
You sent for me.
Yes, I did.

584
01:12:34,553 --> 01:12:37,637
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

585
01:12:37,722 --> 01:12:39,133
You could be magnificent.

586
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:42,474
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

587
01:12:43,311 --> 01:12:46,396
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

588
01:12:49,818 --> 01:12:53,685
The young emperor
has arranged a series of spectacles

589
01:12:53,822 --> 01:12:57,985
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

590
01:12:58,493 --> 01:13:00,486
I find that amusing

591
01:13:00,829 --> 01:13:03,865
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise

592
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:07,415
the all knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

593
01:13:10,422 --> 01:13:14,550
So finally,
after five years of scratching a living

594
01:13:14,676 --> 01:13:16,834
in flea infested villages

595
01:13:16,928 --> 01:13:20,013
we're finally going back to where we belong:

596
01:13:20,724 --> 01:13:22,266
The Colosseum.

597
01:13:24,519 --> 01:13:27,306
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

598
01:13:28,648 --> 01:13:30,724
Fifty thousand Romans

599
01:13:31,651 --> 01:13:35,483
watching every movement of your sword

600
01:13:36,907 --> 01:13:39,362
willing you to make that killer blow.

601
01:13:40,577 --> 01:13:44,242
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

602
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:48,825
It rises. It rises up

603
01:13:50,378 --> 01:13:52,003
like a storm.

604
01:13:52,464 --> 01:13:54,871
As if you were the thunder god himself.

605
01:13:55,175 --> 01:13:58,176
You were a gladiator?
Yes, I was.

606
01:14:04,601 --> 01:14:06,677
You won your freedom?

607
01:14:06,853 --> 01:14:09,261
A long time ago, the Emperor

608
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:13,057
presented me with a rudius.

609
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:16,646
It's just a wooden sword.

610
01:14:17,489 --> 01:14:19,731
The symbol of your freedom.

611
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:24,946
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

612
01:14:26,289 --> 01:14:28,697
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

613
01:14:28,792 --> 01:14:32,624
I did not say I knew him.
I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

614
01:14:33,672 --> 01:14:35,830
You asked me what I want.

615
01:14:37,092 --> 01:14:40,046
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor

616
01:14:41,304 --> 01:14:42,715
as you did.

617
01:14:42,806 --> 01:14:46,222
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

618
01:14:47,102 --> 01:14:50,186
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

619
01:14:51,356 --> 01:14:54,025
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

620
01:14:55,151 --> 01:14:58,437
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

621
01:15:02,909 --> 01:15:04,783
I will win the crowd.

622
01:15:07,038 --> 01:15:10,075
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

623
01:15:11,501 --> 01:15:14,621
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together

624
01:15:15,171 --> 01:15:16,963
and have bloody adventures.

625
01:15:17,048 --> 01:15:19,041
And the great whore
will suckle us

626
01:15:19,134 --> 01:15:21,541
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

627
01:15:21,636 --> 01:15:23,047
And then

628
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,303
when enough men have died

629
01:15:28,476 --> 01:15:30,932
perhaps you will have your freedom.

630
01:15:35,358 --> 01:15:37,730
Here. Use this.

631
01:16:01,426 --> 01:16:04,593
It's somewhere out there, my country.

632
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,961
My home.

633
01:16:08,183 --> 01:16:10,306
My wife is preparing food.

634
01:16:11,311 --> 01:16:14,016
My daughters carry water from the river.

635
01:16:15,357 --> 01:16:17,396
Will I ever see them again?

636
01:16:18,652 --> 01:16:20,194
I think, no.

637
01:16:20,487 --> 01:16:22,942
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

638
01:16:23,031 --> 01:16:24,442
I think so.

639
01:16:25,033 --> 01:16:28,117
But then, I will die soon.

640
01:16:29,746 --> 01:16:32,202
They will not die for many years.

641
01:16:32,999 --> 01:16:34,659
I'll have to wait.

642
01:16:34,751 --> 01:16:36,957
But you would? Wait?

643
01:16:37,587 --> 01:16:38,916
Of course.

644
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,216
You see

645
01:16:43,385 --> 01:16:44,760
my wife

646
01:16:46,263 --> 01:16:50,177
and my son are already waiting for me.

647
01:16:50,934 --> 01:16:54,552
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

648
01:16:58,650 --> 01:16:59,978
Not yet.

649
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:03,028
Unless
Not yet.

650
01:17:07,242 --> 01:17:08,321
Not yet.

651
01:17:21,715 --> 01:17:22,995
There he is.

652
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,255
Out.

653
01:18:14,476 --> 01:18:16,385
Move, go, out!

654
01:18:29,115 --> 01:18:31,689
Good to see you again,
old friend.

655
01:18:36,957 --> 01:18:38,665
Bring me fortune.

656
01:18:43,255 --> 01:18:46,125
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

657
01:18:47,217 --> 01:18:49,790
I didn't know men could build such things.

658
01:18:59,771 --> 01:19:01,313
Win the crowd.

659
01:19:01,565 --> 01:19:03,806
Get inside. Move.

660
01:19:03,984 --> 01:19:05,264
Inside.

661
01:19:54,492 --> 01:19:57,197
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

662
01:20:00,165 --> 01:20:02,241
Come, brother. It's late.

663
01:20:05,837 --> 01:20:08,755
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

664
01:20:11,468 --> 01:20:14,801
That is what Gracchus and his friends
don't understand.

665
01:20:15,222 --> 01:20:18,507
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

666
01:20:25,523 --> 01:20:28,228
Commodus, drink this tonic.

667
01:20:37,827 --> 01:20:40,449
I think the time is almost right.

668
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:43,451
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate

669
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:45,701
at the celebration to honor our father.

670
01:20:45,794 --> 01:20:47,870
Do you think I should?

671
01:20:48,505 --> 01:20:50,544
Are the people ready?

672
01:20:52,551 --> 01:20:54,923
I think you need your rest now.

673
01:21:00,892 --> 01:21:02,684
Will you stay with me?

674
01:21:02,769 --> 01:21:05,177
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

675
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:13,143
Still.

676
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:16,270
Always.

677
01:21:17,993 --> 01:21:20,863
Stay with me tonight.
You know I won't.

678
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:26,869
Then kiss me.

679
01:21:35,677 --> 01:21:37,255
Sleep, brother.

680
01:22:30,023 --> 01:22:32,146
Having servants who are deaf and mute

681
01:22:32,234 --> 01:22:34,985
at least ensures I live a little longer.

682
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,105
They're arresting scholars now.

683
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:43,031
Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

684
01:22:43,662 --> 01:22:45,571
And mathematicians.

685
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,948
And all to feed the arena.

686
01:22:50,585 --> 01:22:53,123
The Senate did not approve martial law.

687
01:22:53,213 --> 01:22:56,416
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

688
01:22:57,092 --> 01:22:59,215
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

689
01:22:59,302 --> 01:23:02,754
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

690
01:23:02,973 --> 01:23:07,635
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

691
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:13,398
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myself with.

692
01:23:14,192 --> 01:23:17,110
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed

693
01:23:17,195 --> 01:23:20,030
planning the festival to honor your father.

694
01:23:20,115 --> 01:23:23,697
He neglects even the most fundamental task
of government.

695
01:23:24,452 --> 01:23:26,659
So just what is he planning?

696
01:23:27,038 --> 01:23:28,663
And what pays for it?

697
01:23:28,748 --> 01:23:32,960
These daily games are costing a fortune,
yet we have no new taxes.

698
01:23:33,712 --> 01:23:35,122
The future.

699
01:23:36,548 --> 01:23:38,540
The future pays for it.

700
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:42,548
He's started selling the grain reserves.

701
01:23:43,013 --> 01:23:44,839
This can't be true.

702
01:23:45,432 --> 01:23:48,183
He's selling
Rome's reserves of grain.

703
01:23:48,518 --> 01:23:51,436
The people will be starving in two years.

704
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,474
I hope they're enjoying the games

705
01:23:53,565 --> 01:23:56,934
because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.

706
01:23:57,277 --> 01:23:59,602
Rome must know this.
And how?

707
01:24:00,113 --> 01:24:02,485
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

708
01:24:03,074 --> 01:24:06,609
And who will tell them before it's too late?
You, Gracchus?

709
01:24:07,996 --> 01:24:09,490
You, Gaius.

710
01:24:09,581 --> 01:24:13,579
Will you make a speech on the floor
of the Senate, denouncing my brother?

711
01:24:13,668 --> 01:24:16,206
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

712
01:24:17,214 --> 01:24:18,542
Who'd dare?

713
01:24:27,724 --> 01:24:30,725
I have been living
in a prison of fear every day

714
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:33,432
because my son is heir to the throne.

715
01:24:39,069 --> 01:24:40,527
He must die.

716
01:24:44,908 --> 01:24:48,656
Quintus and the Praetorians
would simply seize control for themselves.

717
01:24:48,745 --> 01:24:52,577
No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.

718
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:54,742
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

719
01:24:54,834 --> 01:24:58,963
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.

720
01:25:00,507 --> 01:25:02,001
So we do nothing?

721
01:25:02,092 --> 01:25:04,879
No, child. We keep our counsel.

722
01:25:05,845 --> 01:25:07,256
We prepare.

723
01:25:08,098 --> 01:25:12,843
As long as the people support him,
we are voices without steel.

724
01:25:13,645 --> 01:25:15,056
We are air.

725
01:25:18,108 --> 01:25:20,859
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

726
01:25:20,944 --> 01:25:23,814
One day,
he'll have more enemies than friends.

727
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:27,193
And on that day, we will act.

728
01:25:27,784 --> 01:25:29,658
Then we will strike.

729
01:25:30,579 --> 01:25:32,322
But until then

730
01:25:33,498 --> 01:25:35,040
we are docile.

731
01:25:35,542 --> 01:25:37,700
We are obedient.

732
01:25:39,296 --> 01:25:41,288
And we are treacherous.

733
01:25:49,931 --> 01:25:51,176
Come on!

734
01:25:59,941 --> 01:26:01,981
All right, that's enough.

735
01:26:24,549 --> 01:26:28,298
The Emperor wants battles, and I don't want
to sacrifice my best fighters.

736
01:26:28,386 --> 01:26:31,553
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

737
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,222
You get the battle of Carthage.
Massacre of Carthage.

738
01:26:36,811 --> 01:26:40,679
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,
round up all the beggars and thieves?

739
01:26:40,774 --> 01:26:41,936
We've done that.

740
01:26:42,025 --> 01:26:45,643
If you want to give away the best gladiators
in the whole of the empire

741
01:26:45,737 --> 01:26:47,860
then I want double the rates.

742
01:26:47,948 --> 01:26:51,696
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract cancelled.

743
01:26:51,785 --> 01:26:53,244
You don't like it?

744
01:26:53,328 --> 01:26:57,278
Then you can crawl back
down that shit hole that you came from.

745
01:27:00,377 --> 01:27:02,749
Cassius, please. You can free us.

746
01:27:32,409 --> 01:27:35,410
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

747
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:36,693
Yes.

748
01:27:37,497 --> 01:27:39,656
They said you were a giant.

749
01:27:39,791 --> 01:27:42,911
They said you could crush a man's skull
with one hand.

750
01:27:43,044 --> 01:27:44,788
A man's? No.

751
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:47,411
A boy's.

752
01:27:49,467 --> 01:27:53,002
Do they have good horses in Spain?
Some of the best.

753
01:27:54,055 --> 01:27:57,140
This is Argento and this is Scarto.

754
01:27:58,518 --> 01:28:00,345
They were my horses.

755
01:28:01,271 --> 01:28:03,347
They were taken from me.

756
01:28:03,648 --> 01:28:06,934
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

757
01:28:07,485 --> 01:28:10,819
They let you watch the games?
My uncle says it makes me strong.

758
01:28:10,906 --> 01:28:14,191
And what does your father say?
My father is dead.

759
01:28:15,994 --> 01:28:18,034
Master Lucius, it is time.

760
01:28:19,331 --> 01:28:20,659
I have to go.

761
01:28:20,749 --> 01:28:22,326
Your name is Lucius?

762
01:28:24,461 --> 01:28:27,130
Lucius Verus, after my father.

763
01:28:57,744 --> 01:28:59,487
Lower!

764
01:29:04,626 --> 01:29:06,085
Claudius!

765
01:29:06,336 --> 01:29:08,744
Yes?
More shields!

766
01:29:08,838 --> 01:29:10,381
All right.

767
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:33,896
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him

768
01:29:33,989 --> 01:29:36,065
and then speak together.

769
01:29:36,825 --> 01:29:40,324
Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.

770
01:29:41,413 --> 01:29:44,283
Go, and die with honor.

771
01:30:39,346 --> 01:30:41,422
Hail, mighty Caesar!

772
01:30:44,643 --> 01:30:48,890
Caesar!

773
01:30:51,942 --> 01:30:54,896
We who are about to die
salute you!

774
01:30:56,613 --> 01:30:58,321
On this day

775
01:30:58,907 --> 01:31:01,943
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

776
01:31:02,827 --> 01:31:06,446
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall

777
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,616
of mighty Carthage!

778
01:31:12,295 --> 01:31:16,673
On the barren plain of Zama

779
01:31:17,342 --> 01:31:20,343
there stood the invincible armies

780
01:31:20,804 --> 01:31:23,425
of the barbarian Hannibal.

781
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:27,307
Ferocious mercenaries
and warriors

782
01:31:27,394 --> 01:31:29,766
from all brute nations

783
01:31:29,854 --> 01:31:34,148
bent on merciless destruction

784
01:31:35,026 --> 01:31:36,355
conquest.

785
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:41,365
Your emperor is pleased to give you

786
01:31:41,449 --> 01:31:44,534
the barbarian horde!

787
01:31:52,878 --> 01:31:54,835
Anyone here been in the army?

788
01:31:54,921 --> 01:31:57,875
Yes. I served with you
at Vindobona.

789
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,342
You can help me.

790
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,008
Whatever comes out of these gates

791
01:32:05,056 --> 01:32:08,390
we've got a better chance of survival
if we work together.

792
01:32:08,894 --> 01:32:10,637
Do you understand?

793
01:32:12,731 --> 01:32:14,807
If we stay together, we survive.

794
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:18,019
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires

795
01:32:18,111 --> 01:32:21,694
of Scipio Africanus!

796
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,208
To the death!

797
01:32:38,006 --> 01:32:40,579
Kill!

798
01:32:44,429 --> 01:32:46,054
Stay close.

799
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:53,894
Come together!

800
01:32:55,232 --> 01:32:59,276
Stay close. Staggered columns!

801
01:33:12,123 --> 01:33:14,033
You don't have a chance.

802
01:33:25,887 --> 01:33:28,425
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

803
01:33:29,933 --> 01:33:31,475
Hold!

804
01:33:33,645 --> 01:33:36,562
Hold! As one!

805
01:33:39,484 --> 01:33:40,813
Well done.

806
01:33:52,664 --> 01:33:56,496
Hold. Down low!

807
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:03,503
Yes!

808
01:34:15,645 --> 01:34:16,843
Hagen!

809
01:34:41,004 --> 01:34:44,539
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

810
01:34:48,178 --> 01:34:49,553
Quickly!

811
01:34:50,222 --> 01:34:52,973
Get out there.
Hurry!

812
01:35:34,182 --> 01:35:35,380
Maximus!

813
01:35:47,571 --> 01:35:49,943
Single column!

814
01:36:35,285 --> 01:36:36,660
We win!

815
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:44,621
My history's a little hazy, Cassius

816
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:48,338
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

817
01:36:48,423 --> 01:36:50,166
Yes, sire.

818
01:36:52,135 --> 01:36:53,464
Forgive me, sire.

819
01:36:53,553 --> 01:36:56,258
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

820
01:36:57,015 --> 01:36:58,178
Who is he?

821
01:36:58,266 --> 01:37:01,267
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

822
01:37:03,772 --> 01:37:05,599
I think I'll meet him.

823
01:37:05,774 --> 01:37:07,149
Yes, sire.

824
01:37:09,319 --> 01:37:11,193
Hail to the barbarians!

825
01:37:26,169 --> 01:37:29,538
Forward! Arms at ready!

826
01:37:43,144 --> 01:37:44,804
Drop your weapons.

827
01:37:48,817 --> 01:37:51,734
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

828
01:37:52,404 --> 01:37:54,527
I am at the Emperor's service.

829
01:38:21,266 --> 01:38:23,424
Rise.

830
01:38:32,944 --> 01:38:35,020
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

831
01:38:35,113 --> 01:38:37,782
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator
to match you.

832
01:38:37,866 --> 01:38:40,653
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

833
01:38:40,744 --> 01:38:42,286
Or was it Hercules?

834
01:38:43,705 --> 01:38:47,454
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

835
01:38:49,586 --> 01:38:51,210
You do have a name.

836
01:38:51,963 --> 01:38:53,872
My name is Gladiator.

837
01:38:57,135 --> 01:39:00,302
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

838
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:04,973
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

839
01:39:16,821 --> 01:39:19,312
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius

840
01:39:19,658 --> 01:39:21,615
commander of the armies of the north

841
01:39:21,701 --> 01:39:24,157
general of the Felix Legions

842
01:39:24,246 --> 01:39:27,496
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius

843
01:39:28,833 --> 01:39:30,992
father to a murdered son

844
01:39:31,503 --> 01:39:33,792
husband to a murdered wife

845
01:39:34,172 --> 01:39:37,837
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

846
01:39:44,849 --> 01:39:46,260
Arms!

847
01:39:59,364 --> 01:40:02,698
Live!

848
01:40:49,998 --> 01:40:52,703
Arms, at rest!

849
01:41:45,136 --> 01:41:49,633
Maximus!

850
01:42:37,689 --> 01:42:38,934
Father.

851
01:43:53,265 --> 01:43:55,222
Why is he still alive?

852
01:43:56,434 --> 01:43:57,929
I don't know.

853
01:43:58,436 --> 01:44:00,061
He shouldn't be alive.

854
01:44:00,855 --> 01:44:02,266
It vexes me.

855
01:44:04,025 --> 01:44:05,769
I'm terribly vexed.

856
01:44:16,955 --> 01:44:18,948
I did what I had to do.

857
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:23,752
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

858
01:44:23,837 --> 01:44:25,461
You do see that.

859
01:44:25,881 --> 01:44:27,043
Yes.

860
01:44:31,803 --> 01:44:35,089
What did you feel when you saw him?

861
01:44:37,142 --> 01:44:38,802
I felt nothing.

862
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:43,308
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

863
01:44:44,316 --> 01:44:46,557
No more than I wounded him.

864
01:44:51,114 --> 01:44:53,320
They lied to me in Germania.

865
01:44:54,993 --> 01:44:57,069
They told me he was dead.

866
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:01,654
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

867
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:05,077
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

868
01:45:06,421 --> 01:45:08,793
Then you must let the legions know

869
01:45:08,882 --> 01:45:12,002
their treachery will not go unpunished.

870
01:45:12,844 --> 01:45:14,469
Poor sister.

871
01:45:14,679 --> 01:45:17,135
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

872
01:45:18,350 --> 01:45:20,093
What will you do?

873
01:45:33,031 --> 01:45:34,359
This way.

874
01:46:09,818 --> 01:46:13,234
Rich matrons pay well
to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

875
01:46:13,321 --> 01:46:15,812
I knew your brother would send assassins.

876
01:46:16,324 --> 01:46:18,946
I didn't realize he would send his best.

877
01:46:20,579 --> 01:46:22,655
Maximus, he doesn't know.

878
01:46:23,623 --> 01:46:26,826
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

879
01:46:26,918 --> 01:46:29,456
I knew nothing
Don't lie to me!

880
01:46:35,844 --> 01:46:37,504
I wept for them.

881
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:41,511
As you wept for your father?

882
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:45,182
I have been living in a prison of fear
since that day.

883
01:46:45,687 --> 01:46:49,519
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

884
01:46:50,442 --> 01:46:53,608
To live in terror
every moment of every day

885
01:46:53,695 --> 01:46:56,482
because your son is heir to the throne.

886
01:46:58,366 --> 01:46:59,825
I have wept.

887
01:47:01,161 --> 01:47:03,996
My son was innocent.

888
01:47:04,831 --> 01:47:06,871
So is mine.

889
01:47:08,877 --> 01:47:11,961
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

890
01:47:13,423 --> 01:47:16,377
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

891
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:20,297
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

892
01:47:20,388 --> 01:47:23,840
Today I saw a slave become more powerful
than the emperor of Rome.

893
01:47:23,934 --> 01:47:25,725
The gods have spared me?

894
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:29,262
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

895
01:47:29,356 --> 01:47:31,064
That is power.

896
01:47:31,358 --> 01:47:32,520
The mob is Rome.

897
01:47:32,609 --> 01:47:36,357
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

898
01:47:36,571 --> 01:47:38,113
Listen to me.

899
01:47:38,657 --> 01:47:41,574
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

900
01:47:41,868 --> 01:47:44,110
But while the people follow him

901
01:47:44,204 --> 01:47:47,205
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

902
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:50,615
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

903
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:54,329
There are some politicians
who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

904
01:47:54,422 --> 01:47:56,166
One man above all.

905
01:47:57,259 --> 01:48:00,343
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

906
01:48:00,679 --> 01:48:02,588
Do you not understand?

907
01:48:02,847 --> 01:48:07,094
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

908
01:48:07,185 --> 01:48:09,807
What possible difference can I make?

909
01:48:10,105 --> 01:48:12,347
This man wants what you want.

910
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,682
Then have him kill Commodus!

911
01:48:17,237 --> 01:48:19,064
I knew a man once

912
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:21,318
a noble man.

913
01:48:22,242 --> 01:48:25,159
A man of principle who loved my father

914
01:48:26,162 --> 01:48:28,202
and my father loved him.

915
01:48:30,166 --> 01:48:32,325
This man served Rome well.

916
01:48:36,673 --> 01:48:38,381
That man is gone.

917
01:48:39,551 --> 01:48:41,674
Your brother did his work well.

918
01:48:41,761 --> 01:48:43,421
Let me help you.

919
01:48:49,352 --> 01:48:52,437
Yes, you can help me.

920
01:48:55,775 --> 01:48:59,476
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

921
01:49:03,158 --> 01:49:05,910
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

922
01:49:34,356 --> 01:49:36,016
What's your name?

923
01:49:39,027 --> 01:49:40,438
Julian Crassus.

924
01:49:46,117 --> 01:49:47,315
Name?

925
01:49:48,662 --> 01:49:50,156
Marcus, sire.

926
01:49:51,081 --> 01:49:52,908
My father's name.

927
01:50:00,298 --> 01:50:05,007
They must have known of Maximus' escape
when they found the bodies of the four men.

928
01:50:05,845 --> 01:50:08,419
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

929
01:50:09,474 --> 01:50:12,641
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

930
01:50:19,901 --> 01:50:21,941
Load your arrows!

931
01:50:28,869 --> 01:50:30,778
Prepare to fire!

932
01:50:51,766 --> 01:50:55,052
Then perhaps it was you
who knew

933
01:50:55,896 --> 01:50:57,354
and never told me.

934
01:50:57,856 --> 01:51:00,098
I didn't know.
You didn't know?

935
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:04,445
But a general
is always in control.

936
01:51:05,822 --> 01:51:09,487
Always in command, isn't he?

937
01:51:11,036 --> 01:51:12,494
Yes, Caesar.

938
01:51:26,426 --> 01:51:29,095
Then give the command. Say it.

939
01:51:46,029 --> 01:51:47,192
Fire.

940
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:23,721
Maximus.

941
01:52:24,484 --> 01:52:27,604
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

942
01:52:28,488 --> 01:52:30,730
Yes.
In Germania?

943
01:52:32,617 --> 01:52:34,361
In many countries.

944
01:52:35,954 --> 01:52:37,282
General.

945
01:53:26,379 --> 01:53:28,253
You have a great name.

946
01:53:29,799 --> 01:53:32,800
He must kill your name before he kills you.

947
01:53:41,770 --> 01:53:43,098
Yes, at the far end.

948
01:53:43,188 --> 01:53:45,513
Senator Gaius.
Hello.

949
01:53:45,607 --> 01:53:47,564
Senator Gracchus.

950
01:53:49,194 --> 01:53:52,563
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures
of the vulgar crowd.

951
01:53:52,656 --> 01:53:55,822
I don't pretend to be a man of the people,
Senator

952
01:53:55,909 --> 01:53:58,447
but I do try to be a man for the people.

953
01:54:14,636 --> 01:54:19,132
Caesar!

954
01:54:24,396 --> 01:54:26,104
People of Rome!

955
01:54:28,358 --> 01:54:30,766
On the fourth day of Antioch

956
01:54:31,403 --> 01:54:35,780
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

957
01:54:36,408 --> 01:54:40,655
And in his majestic charity

958
01:54:41,413 --> 01:54:45,624
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

959
01:54:46,209 --> 01:54:49,625
with an historical final match.

960
01:54:50,422 --> 01:54:55,000
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement

961
01:54:56,428 --> 01:54:59,879
Caesar is pleased to bring you

962
01:54:59,973 --> 01:55:03,757
the only undefeated champion

963
01:55:03,852 --> 01:55:05,844
in Roman history:

964
01:55:05,937 --> 01:55:10,813
The legendary Tigris of Gaul!

965
01:55:32,464 --> 01:55:35,630
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

966
01:55:35,717 --> 01:55:38,386
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

967
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:41,221
This is not it.

968
01:55:41,306 --> 01:55:44,141
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

969
01:55:44,976 --> 01:55:47,598
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

970
01:55:48,271 --> 01:55:50,347
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

971
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:54,307
Representing the training lyceum
of Antonius Proximo

972
01:55:54,402 --> 01:55:58,067
Caesar is proud to give you

973
01:55:58,156 --> 01:56:01,988
Aelius Maximus!

974
01:56:14,798 --> 01:56:17,170
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

975
01:56:17,259 --> 01:56:21,173
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

976
01:56:23,932 --> 01:56:26,767
No, much sooner than that.

977
01:56:28,687 --> 01:56:30,478
It's been arranged.

978
01:56:48,999 --> 01:56:51,953
We who are about to die salute you.

979
01:56:55,255 --> 01:56:57,212
We're with you, Maximus!

980
01:57:39,674 --> 01:57:41,216
Fight on, finish it!

981
01:58:09,704 --> 01:58:11,364
Pull, pull!

982
01:58:43,738 --> 01:58:45,316
Loose! Loose!

983
01:59:13,393 --> 01:59:15,469
Gut him!
Kill!

984
01:59:16,938 --> 01:59:20,521
Kill!

985
02:00:20,877 --> 02:00:23,084
Maximus the Merciful!

986
02:00:32,264 --> 02:00:37,056
Maximus!

987
02:00:44,359 --> 02:00:47,194
Forward, arms at ready!

988
02:01:17,851 --> 02:01:20,342
What am I going to do
with you?

989
02:01:21,354 --> 02:01:24,854
You simply won't die.

990
02:01:29,654 --> 02:01:31,980
Are we so different, you and I?

991
02:01:33,116 --> 02:01:36,034
You take life when you have to, as I do.

992
02:01:37,412 --> 02:01:41,457
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

993
02:01:41,625 --> 02:01:43,368
Then take it now.

994
02:01:56,389 --> 02:01:58,429
They tell me your son

995
02:01:59,226 --> 02:02:03,140
squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.

996
02:02:05,315 --> 02:02:06,975
And your wife

997
02:02:08,193 --> 02:02:10,102
moaned like a whore

998
02:02:11,238 --> 02:02:15,781
when they ravaged her again and again

999
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:18,535
and again.

1000
02:02:23,792 --> 02:02:27,540
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end

1001
02:02:32,175 --> 02:02:33,504
Highness.

1002
02:02:50,819 --> 02:02:52,646
Maximus!

1003
02:03:01,037 --> 02:03:02,413
General!

1004
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:10,996
General!
Cicero!

1005
02:03:18,722 --> 02:03:21,010
Where are you camped?
Ostia.

1006
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:30,434
We love you, Maximus!
Praise the victor!

1007
02:03:30,525 --> 02:03:33,063
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

1008
02:03:33,153 --> 02:03:35,478
Move along!
Find me!

1009
02:04:00,847 --> 02:04:02,804
Can they hear you?

1010
02:04:06,394 --> 02:04:09,894
Who?
Your family, in the afterlife.

1011
02:04:12,359 --> 02:04:14,980
Yes.
What do you say to them?

1012
02:04:18,615 --> 02:04:20,074
To my boy

1013
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:24,448
I tell him I will see him again soon

1014
02:04:24,538 --> 02:04:28,156
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

1015
02:04:29,417 --> 02:04:30,912
To my wife

1016
02:04:33,421 --> 02:04:35,544
that is not your business.

1017
02:04:43,306 --> 02:04:46,177
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1018
02:04:47,602 --> 02:04:51,137
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1019
02:04:52,482 --> 02:04:56,729
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

1020
02:04:57,862 --> 02:04:59,606
He is defying you.

1021
02:04:59,781 --> 02:05:03,197
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1022
02:05:03,326 --> 02:05:06,944
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1023
02:05:07,664 --> 02:05:10,581
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1024
02:05:12,043 --> 02:05:13,835
Kill him.
No.

1025
02:05:15,714 --> 02:05:18,121
I will not make a martyr of him.

1026
02:05:25,265 --> 02:05:27,803
When I went to the Senate today

1027
02:05:27,893 --> 02:05:32,768
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1028
02:05:34,190 --> 02:05:36,349
And did you note what happened?

1029
02:05:36,443 --> 02:05:39,646
Nothing.
Exactly. Nothing.

1030
02:05:40,655 --> 02:05:43,027
Not a single word of protest.

1031
02:05:43,116 --> 02:05:46,699
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.

1032
02:05:46,786 --> 02:05:47,949
Why?

1033
02:05:49,706 --> 02:05:53,371
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1034
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:57,789
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1035
02:05:57,964 --> 02:06:01,713
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean
as if wounded.

1036
02:06:02,135 --> 02:06:04,970
Then its enemies will approach

1037
02:06:05,055 --> 02:06:08,139
and yet it will lie quite still.

1038
02:06:08,475 --> 02:06:12,307
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it

1039
02:06:12,395 --> 02:06:15,645
and yet it remains still.

1040
02:06:18,902 --> 02:06:20,064
So

1041
02:06:21,404 --> 02:06:23,148
we will lie still

1042
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:27,324
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1043
02:06:28,370 --> 02:06:30,611
Have every senator followed.

1044
02:06:48,306 --> 02:06:52,090
Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps
I'd seen you for the last time.

1045
02:06:52,185 --> 02:06:54,593
I thought you were dead.
Close.

1046
02:06:54,688 --> 02:06:57,807
How long have the men been in Ostia?
All winter.

1047
02:06:58,108 --> 02:07:01,358
And how do they look?
Fat and bored.

1048
02:07:02,070 --> 02:07:05,237
Who's in command?
Some fool from Rome.

1049
02:07:06,533 --> 02:07:08,775
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

1050
02:07:08,869 --> 02:07:10,660
For you, tomorrow.

1051
02:07:11,913 --> 02:07:14,404
I need you to do something for me.

1052
02:07:19,045 --> 02:07:20,456
Come, see, witness.

1053
02:07:20,547 --> 02:07:23,583
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1054
02:07:23,675 --> 02:07:27,293
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1055
02:07:27,387 --> 02:07:29,960
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone

1056
02:07:30,056 --> 02:07:32,096
by doing this to him, they do

1057
02:07:33,018 --> 02:07:34,346
My goodness!

1058
02:07:36,146 --> 02:07:39,729
He got him, he's defeated.
Give way!

1059
02:07:45,864 --> 02:07:48,533
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

1060
02:07:48,617 --> 02:07:50,027
Back.
My lady.

1061
02:07:50,118 --> 02:07:52,276
I served your father at Vindobona.

1062
02:07:52,621 --> 02:07:53,700
Back!

1063
02:07:53,788 --> 02:07:56,992
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

1064
02:07:58,501 --> 02:07:59,664
Stop.

1065
02:08:02,714 --> 02:08:04,125
Stand back.

1066
02:08:05,425 --> 02:08:08,461
The General sends word,
he will meet your politician.

1067
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:13,430
For your loyalty, soldier.
Thank you, my lady.

1068
02:08:23,235 --> 02:08:24,693
Leave us.

1069
02:08:30,283 --> 02:08:31,991
Senator Gracchus.

1070
02:08:45,799 --> 02:08:47,079
General.

1071
02:08:48,176 --> 02:08:50,881
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough

1072
02:08:50,971 --> 02:08:54,090
that you can trust me.

1073
02:08:58,436 --> 02:09:00,892
The Senate is with you?
The Senate?

1074
02:09:02,399 --> 02:09:05,103
Yes. I can speak for them.

1075
02:09:05,694 --> 02:09:09,063
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1076
02:09:09,406 --> 02:09:11,030
To what end?

1077
02:09:12,325 --> 02:09:14,651
Get me outside the city walls.

1078
02:09:15,245 --> 02:09:19,159
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia.
My army is encamped there.

1079
02:09:19,249 --> 02:09:22,582
By nightfall of the second day,
I'll return at the head of 5,000 men.

1080
02:09:22,669 --> 02:09:24,875
But the legions
all have new commanders

1081
02:09:24,963 --> 02:09:26,374
loyal to Commodus.

1082
02:09:26,464 --> 02:09:29,715
Let my men see me alive,
and you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1083
02:09:29,801 --> 02:09:31,461
This is madness.

1084
02:09:32,053 --> 02:09:35,387
No Roman army has entered the capital
in 100 years.

1085
02:09:35,473 --> 02:09:37,715
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

1086
02:09:37,809 --> 02:09:41,344
The time for half measures and talk is over,
Senator.

1087
02:09:41,855 --> 02:09:44,975
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1088
02:09:46,192 --> 02:09:49,858
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?

1089
02:09:49,946 --> 02:09:51,440
I will leave.

1090
02:09:51,948 --> 02:09:55,780
The soldiers will stay for your protection
under the command of the Senate.

1091
02:09:55,869 --> 02:09:57,031
So

1092
02:09:57,370 --> 02:10:01,617
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

1093
02:10:03,168 --> 02:10:04,627
Tell me why.

1094
02:10:10,133 --> 02:10:13,253
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

1095
02:10:16,306 --> 02:10:18,180
I will kill Commodus.

1096
02:10:20,143 --> 02:10:23,179
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1097
02:10:25,065 --> 02:10:27,307
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1098
02:10:29,069 --> 02:10:31,108
His daughter trusts you.

1099
02:10:35,116 --> 02:10:36,824
I will trust you.

1100
02:10:37,202 --> 02:10:39,241
But we have little time.

1101
02:10:39,788 --> 02:10:41,531
Give me two days

1102
02:10:42,332 --> 02:10:44,574
and I will buy your freedom.

1103
02:10:45,293 --> 02:10:46,871
And you

1104
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:49,796
You stay alive

1105
02:10:51,299 --> 02:10:52,959
or I'll be dead.

1106
02:10:54,803 --> 02:10:56,380
Now we must go.

1107
02:11:23,456 --> 02:11:27,039
He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1108
02:11:27,127 --> 02:11:28,704
He'll find you.

1109
02:12:12,839 --> 02:12:14,333
It won't work.

1110
02:12:15,383 --> 02:12:17,542
The Emperor knows too much.

1111
02:12:18,553 --> 02:12:19,502
And as for me

1112
02:12:21,514 --> 02:12:23,591
it's becoming dangerous.

1113
02:12:24,851 --> 02:12:27,093
You'll be paid on my return.

1114
02:12:29,189 --> 02:12:30,980
I give you my word.

1115
02:12:31,149 --> 02:12:34,233
Your word? What if you don't return?

1116
02:12:35,570 --> 02:12:38,571
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1117
02:12:38,657 --> 02:12:39,855
Trust?

1118
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:45,864
Who am I to trust?

1119
02:12:46,456 --> 02:12:49,991
I will kill Commodus.
Why would I want that?

1120
02:12:50,418 --> 02:12:52,126
He makes me rich.

1121
02:12:57,259 --> 02:13:00,094
I know that you are a man of your word,
General.

1122
02:13:01,846 --> 02:13:04,468
I know that you would die
for honor.

1123
02:13:05,767 --> 02:13:07,724
You would die for Rome.

1124
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:11,937
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1125
02:13:12,023 --> 02:13:14,349
But I, on the other hand

1126
02:13:17,028 --> 02:13:18,820
I'm an entertainer.

1127
02:13:22,325 --> 02:13:23,523
Guard!

1128
02:13:28,373 --> 02:13:30,946
He killed the man who set you free.

1129
02:13:40,135 --> 02:13:41,962
Praetorians, master.

1130
02:13:48,143 --> 02:13:49,388
Halt!

1131
02:14:54,459 --> 02:14:56,452
Where have you been?

1132
02:14:56,711 --> 02:14:58,455
I sent for you.

1133
02:14:59,881 --> 02:15:01,541
Please, brother.

1134
02:15:07,305 --> 02:15:09,179
What's troubling you?

1135
02:15:11,601 --> 02:15:13,973
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1136
02:15:15,772 --> 02:15:17,397
I don't know.

1137
02:15:19,276 --> 02:15:21,352
I thought you'd seen him.

1138
02:15:22,237 --> 02:15:25,107
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

1139
02:15:26,575 --> 02:15:29,778
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1140
02:15:30,203 --> 02:15:32,196
And he will bleed, too.

1141
02:15:33,123 --> 02:15:34,498
Very soon.

1142
02:15:36,001 --> 02:15:37,661
But not tonight.

1143
02:15:52,684 --> 02:15:55,720
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1144
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:58,640
"It's a dream

1145
02:16:00,525 --> 02:16:02,399
"a frightful dream

1146
02:16:04,946 --> 02:16:06,322
"life is."

1147
02:16:08,992 --> 02:16:11,068
Do you think that's true?

1148
02:16:11,828 --> 02:16:13,322
I don't know.

1149
02:16:16,958 --> 02:16:18,452
I think it is.

1150
02:16:21,213 --> 02:16:23,917
And I have only you to share it with.

1151
02:17:01,545 --> 02:17:03,122
Open your mouth.

1152
02:17:40,458 --> 02:17:42,285
You know I love you.

1153
02:17:44,337 --> 02:17:45,915
And I love you.

1154
02:18:22,584 --> 02:18:24,208
Out. Get out!

1155
02:18:25,337 --> 02:18:26,535
Move!

1156
02:18:31,301 --> 02:18:33,377
Congratulations, General.

1157
02:18:33,470 --> 02:18:36,305
You've got very persuasive friends.

1158
02:18:42,187 --> 02:18:44,678
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1159
02:18:44,773 --> 02:18:48,106
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1160
02:18:48,318 --> 02:18:51,936
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1161
02:18:52,614 --> 02:18:56,279
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there
with horses.

1162
02:18:58,286 --> 02:19:00,991
You have done all this?
Yes.

1163
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:03,498
You risk too much.

1164
02:19:04,459 --> 02:19:06,452
I have much to pay for.

1165
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:11,087
You have nothing to pay for.

1166
02:19:11,174 --> 02:19:14,258
You love your son. You're strong for him.

1167
02:19:17,430 --> 02:19:19,838
I am tired of being strong.

1168
02:19:21,893 --> 02:19:26,105
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

1169
02:19:26,481 --> 02:19:29,601
Because your father chose me.
No.

1170
02:19:30,902 --> 02:19:33,191
Because my father loved you.

1171
02:19:37,075 --> 02:19:39,483
And because I loved you.

1172
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:43,740
A long time ago.

1173
02:19:48,503 --> 02:19:50,626
Was I very different then?

1174
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:59,012
You laughed more.

1175
02:20:03,018 --> 02:20:05,425
I have felt alone all my life

1176
02:20:06,730 --> 02:20:08,390
except with you.

1177
02:20:11,484 --> 02:20:12,979
I must go.

1178
02:20:13,528 --> 02:20:14,643
Yes.

1179
02:20:43,141 --> 02:20:44,339
There.

1180
02:20:55,904 --> 02:20:57,446
And I got you.

1181
02:21:00,450 --> 02:21:02,656
Isn't it late
to be playing legionnaire?

1182
02:21:02,744 --> 02:21:04,618
I'm not a legionnaire.

1183
02:21:04,871 --> 02:21:07,493
Not a legionnaire?
I'm a gladiator.

1184
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:10,209
A gladiator?

1185
02:21:10,919 --> 02:21:13,492
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1186
02:21:13,672 --> 02:21:17,088
Wouldn't you rather be
a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1187
02:21:17,175 --> 02:21:19,749
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1188
02:21:22,597 --> 02:21:24,424
The savior of Rome?

1189
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:34,184
And who said that?

1190
02:21:42,993 --> 02:21:44,570
Where's Lucius?

1191
02:21:45,829 --> 02:21:48,201
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1192
02:21:51,084 --> 02:21:52,827
She couldn't.
She did.

1193
02:21:52,919 --> 02:21:55,078
She took it from a basket

1194
02:21:56,381 --> 02:22:00,165
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1195
02:22:01,970 --> 02:22:05,220
It bit her in the breast?
Yes.

1196
02:22:05,932 --> 02:22:09,882
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies

1197
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:14,350
behave very strangely
and do very odd things in the name of love.

1198
02:22:14,441 --> 02:22:17,146
I think it's silly.
So do I.

1199
02:22:20,906 --> 02:22:22,945
Sister, join us.

1200
02:22:23,575 --> 02:22:25,318
I've been reading
to dear Lucius.

1201
02:22:25,410 --> 02:22:27,450
I've been reading, too.
Yes.

1202
02:22:27,537 --> 02:22:31,784
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1203
02:22:33,418 --> 02:22:37,202
We've been reading about the great
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1204
02:22:37,297 --> 02:22:39,835
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

1205
02:22:39,925 --> 02:22:43,543
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1206
02:22:43,637 --> 02:22:48,133
If you're very good, tomorrow night
I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1207
02:22:49,392 --> 02:22:51,136
He was betrayed

1208
02:22:52,062 --> 02:22:54,185
by those closest to him.

1209
02:22:56,066 --> 02:22:57,809
By his own blood.

1210
02:22:59,152 --> 02:23:01,643
They whispered in dark corners

1211
02:23:01,738 --> 02:23:04,027
and went out late at night

1212
02:23:04,282 --> 02:23:07,616
and conspired, and conspired.

1213
02:23:10,163 --> 02:23:14,077
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1214
02:23:14,167 --> 02:23:16,741
He knew they were busy little bees.

1215
02:23:18,672 --> 02:23:21,756
And one night he sat down
with one of them

1216
02:23:22,509 --> 02:23:24,501
and he looked at her

1217
02:23:25,428 --> 02:23:26,971
and he said:

1218
02:23:28,056 --> 02:23:30,594
"Tell me what you've been doing

1219
02:23:31,268 --> 02:23:33,011
"busy little bee.

1220
02:23:35,313 --> 02:23:38,433
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1221
02:23:39,568 --> 02:23:42,652
"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."

1222
02:23:46,241 --> 02:23:48,648
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1223
02:23:50,787 --> 02:23:55,663
The little bee had wounded him more deeply
than anyone else could ever have done.

1224
02:23:57,878 --> 02:24:00,748
What do you think happened then, Lucius?

1225
02:24:01,381 --> 02:24:03,208
I don't know, Uncle.

1226
02:24:09,723 --> 02:24:12,296
The little bee told him everything.

1227
02:25:10,367 --> 02:25:13,451
Open,
in the name of the Emperor!

1228
02:25:14,037 --> 02:25:15,317
Proximo!

1229
02:25:16,206 --> 02:25:19,409
Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!

1230
02:25:23,713 --> 02:25:25,172
Open the gates!

1231
02:25:31,012 --> 02:25:33,301
Open the gates, Proximo.

1232
02:25:33,765 --> 02:25:36,007
Do you want to die, old man?

1233
02:25:37,227 --> 02:25:38,342
Here.

1234
02:25:38,979 --> 02:25:41,055
Everything is prepared.

1235
02:25:41,147 --> 02:25:43,638
It seems you have won your freedom.

1236
02:25:43,733 --> 02:25:47,316
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1237
02:25:52,409 --> 02:25:56,241
Juba.
All enemies of the emperor die!

1238
02:25:56,788 --> 02:25:58,946
Open the gates!

1239
02:26:04,462 --> 02:26:06,420
Pull!

1240
02:26:08,592 --> 02:26:11,427
Move!
Form a column on the left!

1241
02:26:15,223 --> 02:26:18,260
I only need moments,
so do not be careless with your lives.

1242
02:26:18,351 --> 02:26:21,103
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1243
02:26:21,187 --> 02:26:23,346
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1244
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:26,310
Strength and honor.
Go.

1245
02:26:27,193 --> 02:26:29,020
Strength and honor.

1246
02:26:31,656 --> 02:26:34,491
Aim. Arch your bows!

1247
02:27:41,601 --> 02:27:42,882
Shadows and dust.

1248
02:28:24,811 --> 02:28:25,926
Maximus!

1249
02:28:31,526 --> 02:28:32,937
I'm sorry.

1250
02:28:59,346 --> 02:29:00,721
It's done.

1251
02:29:07,687 --> 02:29:09,763
And what of my nephew?

1252
02:29:10,649 --> 02:29:12,641
And what of his mother?

1253
02:29:14,694 --> 02:29:17,268
Should they share her lover's fate?

1254
02:29:18,990 --> 02:29:21,030
Or should I be merciful?

1255
02:29:23,745 --> 02:29:25,654
Commodus the Merciful.

1256
02:29:32,128 --> 02:29:34,417
Lucius will stay with me now.

1257
02:29:35,549 --> 02:29:37,375
And if his mother

1258
02:29:38,802 --> 02:29:40,878
so much as looks at me

1259
02:29:42,055 --> 02:29:44,546
in a manner that displeases me

1260
02:29:46,518 --> 02:29:47,977
he will die.

1261
02:29:51,398 --> 02:29:54,683
If she decides to be noble

1262
02:29:56,444 --> 02:29:58,520
and takes her own life

1263
02:30:00,115 --> 02:30:01,574
he will die.

1264
02:30:05,203 --> 02:30:07,030
And as for you

1265
02:30:09,749 --> 02:30:11,541
you will love me

1266
02:30:12,252 --> 02:30:14,079
as I have loved you.

1267
02:30:15,672 --> 02:30:19,337
You will provide me
with an heir of pure blood

1268
02:30:20,343 --> 02:30:22,135
so that Commodus

1269
02:30:22,721 --> 02:30:25,675
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1270
02:30:30,312 --> 02:30:32,055
Am I not merciful?

1271
02:30:53,919 --> 02:30:56,540
Am I not merciful!

1272
02:31:08,767 --> 02:31:11,970
Maximus!

1273
02:31:40,215 --> 02:31:42,967
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1274
02:31:45,679 --> 02:31:49,973
Nothing happens to anyone
that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1275
02:32:22,924 --> 02:32:24,205
Maximus!

1276
02:32:30,599 --> 02:32:32,508
They call for you.

1277
02:32:34,394 --> 02:32:37,644
The general
who became a slave.

1278
02:32:38,899 --> 02:32:41,306
The slave who became a gladiator.

1279
02:32:42,652 --> 02:32:45,487
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1280
02:32:47,407 --> 02:32:49,115
A striking story.

1281
02:32:50,285 --> 02:32:53,570
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1282
02:32:55,874 --> 02:32:58,116
Only a famous death will do.

1283
02:33:00,045 --> 02:33:02,583
And what could be more glorious

1284
02:33:02,964 --> 02:33:06,713
than to challenge the Emperor himself
in the great arena?

1285
02:33:09,054 --> 02:33:12,090
You would fight me?
Why not?

1286
02:33:13,308 --> 02:33:15,347
Do you think I'm afraid?

1287
02:33:16,144 --> 02:33:19,145
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1288
02:33:19,272 --> 02:33:22,973
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1289
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:31,776
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1290
02:33:33,036 --> 02:33:35,492
"All a man can do is smile back."

1291
02:33:37,290 --> 02:33:38,701
I wonder

1292
02:33:39,334 --> 02:33:42,121
did your friend smile at his own death?

1293
02:33:42,504 --> 02:33:44,046
You must know.

1294
02:33:46,925 --> 02:33:48,716
He was your father.

1295
02:33:52,597 --> 02:33:54,922
You loved my father, I know

1296
02:33:56,434 --> 02:33:57,929
but so did I.

1297
02:33:59,563 --> 02:34:02,136
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1298
02:34:04,776 --> 02:34:06,899
Smile for me now, brother.

1299
02:34:12,409 --> 02:34:15,196
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

1300
02:35:09,633 --> 02:35:11,590
Ring formation!

1301
02:37:03,413 --> 02:37:04,991
Quintus, sword.

1302
02:37:06,499 --> 02:37:08,291
Give me your sword.

1303
02:37:11,713 --> 02:37:13,706
Sword! Give me a sword!

1304
02:37:15,217 --> 02:37:17,043
Sheathe your swords.

1305
02:39:34,231 --> 02:39:35,641
Maximus.

1306
02:39:42,781 --> 02:39:44,109
Quintus.

1307
02:39:45,784 --> 02:39:47,243
Free my men.

1308
02:39:48,703 --> 02:39:51,408
Senator Gracchus
is to be reinstated.

1309
02:39:52,624 --> 02:39:54,700
There was a dream that was Rome.

1310
02:39:55,377 --> 02:39:57,250
It shall be realized.

1311
02:39:58,004 --> 02:40:00,578
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1312
02:40:01,466 --> 02:40:03,542
Free the prisoners. Go!

1313
02:40:28,243 --> 02:40:29,523
Maximus.

1314
02:40:31,454 --> 02:40:33,032
Lucius is safe.

1315
02:40:49,347 --> 02:40:50,758
Go to them.

1316
02:41:40,565 --> 02:41:42,024
You're home.

1317
02:42:08,635 --> 02:42:11,208
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1318
02:42:15,058 --> 02:42:16,885
We believed it once.

1319
02:42:20,063 --> 02:42:22,139
Make us believe it again.

1320
02:42:25,694 --> 02:42:27,770
He was a soldier of Rome.

1321
02:42:31,616 --> 02:42:33,027
Honor him.

1322
02:42:33,493 --> 02:42:35,652
Who will help me carry him?

1323
02:43:20,415 --> 02:43:22,075
Now we are free.

1324
02:43:28,465 --> 02:43:30,339
I will see you again.

1325
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:34,678
But not yet.

1326
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:37,009
Not yet.
